        "\n",
        "This model is called a “Temporal Text Analysis ML model,\" which is focused on historical trends in Black history by analyzing changes in the discussion, perception, and significance of historical events, figures, and cultural developments over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "I would contend that the machine learning technique used for this model falls under two categories and not one: sentiment analysis and topic modelling.\n",
        "\n",
        "The training data used in this model consists of 100+ black history documents downloaded from the publicly available black history database (https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/digital-archives/). Because I am analyzing the change in perception over a long period of time, I believe it's important that I attain my training data from a reputable non-profit organization that has these databases and nothing to profit off of.\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, the dataset was preprocessed to ensure clean, uniform data by standardizing text entries, handling missing values, and converting the 'year' column to an integer for accurate temporal sorting and grouping. Sentiment analysis was conducted using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, where each document within the dataset was analyzed for sentiment polarity scores. These scores were then aggregated to calculate the average sentiment for each year, providing a quantitative measure of how sentiments, either positive or negative, trended over the years.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to sentiment analysis, I conducted detailed topic distribution analysis to uncover how various subjects or themes evolved over time within the corpus. This involved using topic modeling techniques, likely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to categorize documents into coherent topics based on the similarity of their content. After assigning topics to each document, the data was grouped by year and topic to track the frequency and prominence of each topic over time.\n"

JUSTICE POWELL joined.\\n\\n[1A]We granted certiorari to consider a facial constitutional challenge to a requirement in a congressional spending program that, absent an administrative waiver, 10% of the federal funds granted for local public works projects must be used by the state or local grantee to procure services or supplies from businesses owned and controlled by members of statutorily identified minority groups. 441 U.S. 960 (1979).\\n\\nI\\n\\nIn May 1977, Congress enacted the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95-28, 91 Stat. 116, which amended the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94-369, 90 Stat. 999, 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 6701 et seq. The 1977 amendments authorized an additional $ 4 billion appropriation for federal grants to be made by the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Economic Development Administration (EDA), to state and local governmental entities for use in local public works projects. Among the changes made was the addition of the provision that has become the focus of this litigation. Section 103 (f)(2) of the 1977 Act, referred to as the \\u201cminority business enterprise\\u201d or \\u201cMBE\\u201d provision, requires that: n1\\n\\n\\u201cExcept to the extent that the Secretary determines otherwise, no grant shall be made under this Act for any local public works project unless the applicant gives satisfactory assurance to the Secretary that at least 10 per centum of the amount of each grant shall be expended for minority business enterprises. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \\u2018minority business enterprise\\u2019 means a business at least 50 per centum of which is owned by minority group members or, in case of a publicly owned business, at least 51 per centum of the stock of which is owned by minority group members. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, minority group members are citizens of the United States who are Negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn1 91 Stat. 116, 42 U.

Named as defendants were the Secretary of Commerce, as the program administrator, and the State and City of New York, as actual and potential project grantees. Petitioners are several associations of construction contractors and subcontractors, and a firm engaged in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning work. Their complaint alleged that they had sustained economic injury due to enforcement of the 10% MBE requirement and that the MBE provision on its face violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and various statutory antidiscrimination provisions. n5\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn5 42 U.

On December 19, 1977, the District Court issued a memorandum opinion upholding the validity of the MBE program and denying the injunctive relief sought. Fullilove v. Kreps, 443 F.Supp. 253 (1977).\\n\\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, 584 F.2d 600 (1978), holding that \\u201ceven under the most exacting standard of review the MBE provision passes constitutional muster.\\u201d Id., at 603. Considered in the context of many years of governmental efforts to remedy past racial and ethnic discrimination, the court found it \\u201cdifficult to imagine\\u201d any purpose for the program other than to remedy such discrimination. Id., at 605. In its view, a number of factors contributed to the legitimacy of the MBE provision, most significant of which was the narrowed focus and limited extent of the statutory and administrative program, in size, impact, and duration, id., at 607-608; the court looked also to the holdings of other Courts of Appeals and District Courts that the MBE program was constitutional, id., at 608-609. n6 It expressly rejected petitioners\\u2019 contention that the 10% MBE requirement violated the equal protection guarantees of the Constitution. n7 Id., at 609.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn6 Ohio Contractors Assn. v.

The 1976 Act was intended as a short-term measure to alleviate the problem of national unemployment and to stimulate the national economy by assisting state and local governments to build needed public facilities. n8 To accomplish these objectives, the Congress authorized the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the EDA, to make grants to state and local governments for construction, renovation, repair, or other improvement of local public works projects. n9 The 1976 Act placed a number of restrictions on project eligibility designed to assure that federal moneys were targeted to accomplish the legislative purposes. n10 It established criteria to determine grant priorities and to apportion federal funds among political jurisdictions. n11 Those criteria directed grant funds toward areas of high unemployment. n12 The statute authorized the appropriation of up to $ 2 billion for a period ending in September 1977; n13 this appropriation was soon consumed by grants made under the program.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn8 H.

Under administration of the 1976 appropriation, referred to as \\u201cRound I\\u201d of the local public works program, applicants seeking some $ 25 billion in grants had competed for the $ 2 billion in available funds; of nearly 25,000 applications, only some 2,000 were granted. n14 The results provoked widespread concern for the fairness of the allocation process. n15 Because the 1977 Act would authorize the appropriation of an additional $ 4 billion to fund \\u201cRound II\\u201d of the grant program, n16 the congressional hearings and debates concerning the amendments focused primarily on the politically sensitive problems of priority and geographic distribution of grants under the supplemental appropriation. n17 The result of this attention was inclusion in the 1977 Act of provisions revising the allocation criteria of the 1976 legislation. Those provisions, however, retained the underlying objective to direct funds into areas of high unemployment. n18 The 1977 Act also added new restrictions on applicants seeking to qualify for federal grants; n19 among these was the MBE provision.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn14 123 Cong.

R. 11, n24 Representative Mitchell reiterated the need to ensure that minority firms would obtain a fair opportunity to share in the benefits of this Government program. n25\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn22 Id., at 5097-5098.\\n\\nn23 Id., at 5098.\\n\\nn24 Id., at 5327.

Congress relied on the administrative agency to flesh out this skeleton, pursuant to delegated rulemaking authority, and to develop an administrative operation consistent with legislative intentions and objectives.\\n\\nAs required by the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, the Secretary of Commerce promulgated regulations to set into motion \\u201cRound II\\u201d of the federal grant program. n56 The regulations require that construction projects funded under the legislation must be performed under contracts awarded by competitive bidding, unless the federal administrator has made a determination that in the circumstances relating to a particular project some other method is in the public interest.

And, since the contract is to be awarded to the lowest responsive bidder, the same incentive is expected to motivate prime contractors to seek out the most competitive of the available, qualified, bona fide minority firms.

It specifies that waivers may be total or partial, depending on the circumstances, n63 and it illustrates the projected operation of the waiver procedure by posing hypothetical questions with projected administrative responses. One such hypothetical is of particular interest, for it indicates the limitations on the scope of the racial or ethnic preference contemplated by the federal program when a grantee or its prime contractor is confronted with an available, qualified, bona fide minority business enterprise who is not the lowest competitive bidder. The hypothetical provides: n64\\n\\n\\u201cQuestion: Should a request for waiver of the 10% requirement based on an unreasonable price asked by an MBE ever be granted?\\n\\n\\u201cAnswer: It is possible to imagine situations where an MBE might ask a price for its product or services that is unreasonable and where, therefore, a waiver is justified. However, before a waiver request will be honored, the following determinations will be made:\\n\\n\\u201ca) The MBE\\u2019s quote is unreasonably priced. This determination should be based on the nature of the product or service of the subcontractor, the geographic location of the site and of the subcontractor, prices of similar products or services in the relevant market area, and general business conditions in the market area. Furthermore, a subcontractor\\u2019s price should not be considered unreasonable if he is merely trying to cover his costs because the price results from disadvantage which affects the MBE\\u2019s cost of doing business or results from discrimination.\\n\\n\\u201cb) The contractor has contracted other MBEs and has no meaningful choice but to accept an unreasonably high price.\\u201d\\n\\nThis announced policy makes clear the administrative understanding that a waiver or partial waiver is justified (and will be granted) to avoid subcontracting with a minority business enterprise at an \\u201cunreasonable\\u201d price, i. e., a price above competitive levels which cannot be attributed to the minority firm\\u2019s attempt to cover costs inflated by the present effects of disadvantage or discrimination.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn62 Guidelines 13-16; app. 165a-167a.

It will be recalled that in the Report of the House Subcommittee on SBA Oversight and Minority Enterprise the Subcommittee took special care to note that when using the term \\u201cminority\\u201d it intended to include \\u201conly such minority individuals as are considered to be economically or socially disadvantaged.\\u201d n65 The Subcommittee also was cognizant of existing administrative regulations designed to ensure that firms maintained on the lists of bona fide minority business enterprises be those whose competitive position is impaired by the effects of disadvantage and discrimination. In its Report, the Subcommittee expressed its intention that these criteria continue to govern administration of the SBA\\u2019s \\u00a7 8 (a) program. n66 The sponsors of the MBE provision, in their reliance on prior administrative practice, intended that the term \\u201cminority business enterprise\\u201d would be given that same limited application; this even found expression in the legislative debates, where Representative Roe made the point: n67\\n\\n\\u201c[When] we are talking about companies held by minority groups . . .

Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) (opinion of Holmes, J.). A program that employs racial or ethnic criteria, even in a remedial context, calls for close examination; yet we are bound to approach our task with appropriate deference to the Congress, a co-equal branch charged by the Constitution with the power to \\u201cprovide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States\\u201d and \\u201cto enforce, by appropriate legislation,\\u201d the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. Art. I, \\u00a7 8, cl. 1; Amdt. 14, \\u00a7 5. In Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 102 (1973), we accorded \\u201cgreat weight to the decisions of Congress\\u201d even though the legislation implicated fundamental constitutional rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. The rule is not different when a congressional program raises equal protection concerns. See, e. g., Cleland v. National College of Business, 435 U.S. 213 (1978); Mathews v. De Castro, 429 U.S. 181 (1976).\\n\\nHere we pass, not on a choice made by a single judge or a school board, but on a considered decision of the Congress and the President. However, in no sense does that render it immune from judicial scrutiny, and it \\u201cis not to say we \\u2018defer\\u2019 to the judgment of the Congress . . . on a constitutional question,\\u201d or that we would hesitate to invoke the Constitution should we determine that Congress has overstepped the bounds of its constitutional power. Columbia Broadcasting, supra, at 103.\\n\\nThe clear objective of the MBE provision is disclosed by our necessarily extended review of its legislative and administrative background. The program was designed to ensure that, to the extent federal funds were granted under the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, grantees who elect to participate would not employ procurement practices that Congress had decided might result in perpetuation of the effects of prior discrimination which had impaired or foreclosed access by minority businesses to public contracting opportunities. The MBE program does not mandate the allocation of federal funds according to inflexible percentages solely based on race or ethnicity.\\n\\n[1B]Our analysis proceeds in two steps. At the outset, we must inquire whether the objectives of this legislation are within the power of Congress. If so, we must go on to decide whether the limited use of racial and ethnic criteria, in the context presented, is a constitutionally permissible means for achieving the congressional objectives and does not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\\n\\nA\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIn enacting the MBE provision, it is clear that Congress employed an amalgam of its specifically delegated powers. The Public Works Employment Act of 1977, by its very nature, is primarily an exercise of the Spending Power. U.S. Const., Art. I, \\u00a7 8, cl. 1. This Court has recognized that the power to \\u201cprovide for the . . . general Welfare\\u201d is an independent grant of legislative authority, distinct from other broad congressional powers. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 90-91 (1976); United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 65-66 (1936). Congress has frequently employed the Spending Power to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance by the recipient with federal statutory and administrative directives. This Court has repeatedly upheld against constitutional challenge the use of this technique to induce governments and private parties to cooperate voluntarily with federal policy. E. g., California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz, 416 U.S. 21 (1974); Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974); Oklahoma v. CSC, 330 U.S. 127 (1947); Helvering v. Davis, 301 U.S. 619 (1937); Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548 (1937).\\n\\nThe MBE program is structured within this familiar legislative pattern. The program conditions receipt of public works grants upon agreement by the state or local governmental grantee that at least 10% of the federal funds will be devoted to contracts with minority businesses, to the extent this can be accomplished by overcoming barriers to access and by awarding contracts to bona fide MBE\\u2019s. It is further conditioned to require that MBE bids on these contracts are competitively priced, or might have been competitively priced but for the present effects of prior discrimination. Admittedly, the problems of administering this program with respect to these conditions may be formidable. Although the primary responsibility for ensuring minority participation falls upon the grantee, when the procurement practices of the grantee involve the award of a prime contract to a general or prime contractor, the obligations to assure minority participation devolve upon the private contracting party; this is a contractual condition of eligibility for award of the prime contract.\\n\\nHere we need not explore the outermost limitations on the objectives attainable through such an application of the Spending Power. The reach of the Spending Power, within its sphere, is at least as broad as the regulatory powers of Congress. If, pursuant to its regulatory powers, Congress could have achieved the objectives of the MBE program, then it may do so under the Spending Power. And we have no difficulty perceiving a basis for accomplishing the objectives of the MBE program through the Commerce Power insofar as the program objectives pertain to the action of private contracting parties, and through the power to enforce the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment insofar as the program objectives pertain to the action of state and local grantees.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nWe turn first to the Commerce Power. U.S. Const., Art. I, \\u00a7 8, cl. 3. Had Congress chosen to do so, it could have drawn on the Commerce Clause to regulate the practices of prime contractors on federally funded public works projects. Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294 (1964); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964). The legislative history of the MBE provision shows that there was a rational basis for Congress to conclude that the subcontracting practices of prime contractors could perpetuate the prevailing impaired access by minority businesses to public contracting opportunities, and that this inequity has an effect on interstate commerce. Thus Congress could take necessary and proper action to remedy the situation. Ibid.\\n\\nIt is not necessary that these prime contractors be shown responsible for any violation of antidiscrimination laws. Our cases dealing with application of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, express no doubt of the congressional authority to prohibit practices \\u201cchallenged as perpetuating the effects of [not unlawful] discrimination occurring prior to the effective date of the Act.\\u201d Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 761 (1976); see California Brewers Assn. v. Bryant, 444 U.S. 598 (1980); Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324 (1977); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405 (1975); Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971). Insofar as the MBE program pertains to the actions of private prime contractors, the Congress could have achieved its objectives under the Commerce Clause. We conclude that in this respect the objectives of the MBE provision are within the scope of the Spending Power.\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nIn certain contexts, there are limitations on the reach of the Commerce Power to regulate the actions of state and local governments. National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976). To avoid such complications, we look to \\u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment for the power to regulate the procurement practices of state and local grantees of federal funds. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976). A review of our cases persuades us that the objectives of the MBE program are within the power of Congress under \\u00a7 5 \\u201cto enforce, by appropriate legislation,\\u201d the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\n\\nIn Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966), we equated the scope of this authority with the broad powers expressed in the Necessary and Proper Clause, U.S. Const., Art. I, \\u00a7 8, cl. 18. \\u201cCorrectly viewed, \\u00a7 5 is a positive grant of legislative power authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in determining whether and what legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\u201d 384 U.S., at 651. In Katzenbach, the Court upheld \\u00a7 4 (e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1973b (e), which prohibited application of state English-language literacy requirements to otherwise qualified voters who had completed the sixth grade in an accredited American school in which a language other than English was the predominant medium of instruction. To uphold this exercise of congressional authority, the Court found no prerequisite that application of a literacy requirement violate the Equal Protection Clause. 384 U.S., at 648-649. It was enough that the Court could perceive a basis upon which Congress could reasonably predicate a judgment that application of literacy qualifications within the compass of \\u00a7 4 (e) would discriminate in terms of access to the ballot and consequently in terms of access to the provision or administration of governmental programs. Id., at 652-653.\\n\\nFour years later, in Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970), we upheld \\u00a7 201 of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 315, which imposed a 5-year nationwide prohibition on the use of various voter-qualification tests and devices in federal, state, and local elections. The Court was unanimous, albeit in separate opinions, in concluding that Congress was within its authority to prohibit the use of such voter qualifications; Congress could reasonably determine that its legislation was an appropriate method of attacking the perpetuation of prior purposeful discrimination, even though the use of these tests or devices might have discriminatory effects only. See City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 176-177 (1980). Our cases reviewing the parallel power of Congress to enforce the provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment, U.S. Const., Amdt. 15, \\u00a7 2, confirm that congressional authority extends beyond the prohibition of purposeful discrimination to encompass state action that has discriminatory impact perpetuating the effects of past discrimination. South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966); cf. City of Rome, supra.\\n\\nWith respect to the MBE provision, Congress had abundant evidence from which it could conclude that minority businesses have been denied effective participation in public contracting opportunities by procurement practices that perpetuated the effects of prior discrimination. Congress, of course, may legislate without compiling the kind of \\u201crecord\\u201d appropriate with respect to judicial or administrative proceedings. Congress had before it, among other data, evidence of a long history of marked disparity in the percentage of public contracts awarded to minority business enterprises. This disparity was considered to result not from any lack of capable and qualified minority businesses, but from the existence and maintenance of barriers to competitive access which had their roots in racial and ethnic discrimination, and which continue today, even absent any intentional discrimination or other unlawful conduct. Although much of this history related to the experience of minority businesses in the area of federal procurement, there was direct evidence before the Congress that this pattern of disadvantage and discrimination existed with respect to state and local construction contracting as well. In relation to the MBE provision, Congress acted within its competence to determine that the problem was national in scope.\\n\\nAlthough the Act recites no preambulary \\u201cfindings\\u201d on the subject, we are satisfied that Congress had abundant historical basis from which it could conclude that traditional procurement practices, when applied to minority businesses, could perpetuate the effects of prior discrimination. Accordingly, Congress reasonably determined that the prospective elimination of these barriers to minority firm access to public contracting opportunities generated by the 1977 Act was appropriate to ensure that those businesses were not denied equal opportunity to participate in federal grants to state and local governments, which is one aspect of the equal protection of the laws. Insofar as the MBE program pertains to the actions of state and local grantees, Congress could have achieved its objectives by use of its power under \\u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. We conclude that in this respect the objectives of the MBE provision are within the scope of the Spending Power.\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nThere are relevant similarities between the MBE program and the federal spending program reviewed in Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974). In Lau, a language barrier \\u201ceffectively foreclosed\\u201d non-English-speaking Chinese pupils from access to the educational opportunities offered by the San Francisco public school system. Id., at 564-566. It had not been shown that this had resulted from any discrimination, purposeful or otherwise, or from other unlawful acts. Nevertheless, we upheld the constitutionality of a federal regulation applicable to public school systems receiving federal funds that prohibited the utilization of \\u201ccriteria or methods of administration which have the effect . . . of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the [educational] program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.\\u201d Id., at 568 (emphasis added). Moreover, we upheld application to the San Francisco school system, as a recipient of federal funds, of a requirement that \\u201c[where] inability to speak and understand the English language excludes national origin-minority group children from effective participation in the educational program offered by a school district, the district must take affirmative steps to rectify the language deficiency in order to open its instructional program to these students.\\u201d Ibid.\\n\\nIt is true that the MBE provision differs from the program approved in Lau in that the MBE program directly employs racial and ethnic criteria as a means to accomplish congressional objectives; however, these objectives are essentially the same as those approved in Lau. Our holding in Lau is instructive on the exercise of congressional authority by way of the MBE provision. The MBE program, like the federal regulations reviewed in Lau, primarily regulates state action in the use of federal funds voluntarily sought and accepted by the grantees subject to statutory and administrative conditions. The MBE participation requirement is directed at the utilization of criteria, methods, or practices thought by Congress to have the effect of defeating, or substantially impairing, access by the minority business community to public funds made available by congressional appropriations.\\n\\nB\\n\\nWe now turn to the question whether, as a means to accomplish these plainly constitutional objectives, Congress may use racial and ethnic criteria, in this limited way, as a condition attached to a federal grant. We are mindful that \\u201c[in] no matter should we pay more deference to the opinion of Congress than in its choice of instrumentalities to perform a function that is within its power,\\u201d National Mutual Insurance Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co., 337 U.S. 582, 603 (1949) (opinion of Jackson, J.). However, Congress may employ racial or ethnic classifications in exercising its Spending or other legislative powers only if those classifications do not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We recognize the need for careful judicial evaluation to assure that any congressional program that employs racial or ethnic criteria to accomplish the objective of remedying the present effects of past discrimination is narrowly tailored to the achievement of that goal.\\n\\nAgain, we stress the limited scope of our inquiry. Here we are not dealing with a remedial decree of a court but with the legislative authority of Congress. Furthermore, petitioners have challenged the constitutionality of the MBE provision on its face; they have not sought damages or other specific relief for injury allegedly flowing from specific applications of the program; nor have they attempted to show that as applied in identified situations the MBE provision violated the constitutional or statutory rights of any party to this case. n71 In these circumstances, given a reasonable construction and in light of its projected administration, if we find the MBE program on its face to be free of constitutional defects, it must be upheld as within congressional power. Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 760 (1974); Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 438-439 (1965); Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500, 515 (1964); see United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 20-24 (1960).\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn71 In their complaint, in order to establish standing to challenge the validity of the program, petitioners alleged as \\u201c[specific] examples\\u201d of economic injury three instances where one of their number assertedly would have been awarded a public works contract but for enforcement of the MBE provision. Petitioners requested only declaratory and injunctive relief against continued enforcement of the MBE provision; they did not seek any remedy for these specific instances of assertedly unlawful discrimination. App. 12a-13a, 17a-19a.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nOur review of the regulations and guidelines governing administration of the MBE provision reveals that Congress enacted the program as a strictly remedial measure; moreover, it is a remedy that functions prospectively, in the manner of an injunctive decree. Pursuant to the administrative program, grantees and their prime contractors are required to seek out all available, qualified, bona fide MBE\\u2019s; they are required to provide technical assistance as needed, to lower or waive bonding requirements where feasible, to solicit the aid of the Office of Minority Business Enterprise, the SBA, or other sources for assisting MBE\\u2019s to obtain required working capital, and to give guidance through the intricacies of the bidding process. Supra, at 468-469. The program assumes that grantees who undertake these efforts in good faith will obtain at least 10% participation by minority business enterprises. It is recognized that, to achieve this target, contracts will be awarded to available, qualified, bona fide MBE\\u2019s even though they are not the lowest competitive bidders, so long as their higher bids, when challenged, are found to reflect merely attempts to cover costs inflated by the present effects of prior disadvantage and discrimination. Supra, at 470-471. There is available to the grantee a provision authorized by Congress for administrative waiver on a case-by-case basis should there be a demonstration that, despite affirmative efforts, this level of participation cannot be achieved without departing from the objectives of the program. Supra, at 469-470. There is also an administrative mechanism, including a complaint procedure, to ensure that only bona fide MBE\\u2019s are encompassed by the remedial program, and to prevent unjust participation in the program by those minority firms whose access to public contracting opportunities is not impaired by the effects of prior discrimination. Supra, at 471-472.\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nAs a threshold matter, we reject the contention that in the remedial context the Congress must act in a wholly \\u201ccolor-blind\\u201d fashion. In Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 18-21 (1971), we rejected this argument in considering a court-formulated school desegregation remedy on the basis that examination of the racial composition of student bodies was an unavoidable starting point and that racially based attendance assignments were permissible so long as no absolute racial balance of each school was required. In McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U.S. 39, 41 (1971), citing Swann, we observed: \\u201cIn this remedial process, steps will almost invariably require that students be assigned \\u2018differently because of their race.\\u2019 Any other approach would freeze the status quo that is the very target of all desegregation processes.\\u201d (Citations omitted.) And in North Carolina Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43 (1971), we invalidated a state law that absolutely forbade assignment of any student on account of race because it foreclosed implementation of desegregation plans that were designed to remedy constitutional violations. We held that \\u201c[just] as the race of students must be considered in determining whether a constitutional violation has occurred, so also must race be considered in formulating a remedy.\\u201d Id., at 46.\\n\\nIn these school desegregation cases we dealt with the authority of a federal court to formulate a remedy for unconstitutional racial discrimination. However, the authority of a court to incorporate racial criteria into a remedial decree also extends to statutory violations. Where federal antidiscrimination laws have been violated, an equitable remedy may in the appropriate case include a racial or ethnic factor. Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747 (1976); see Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324 (1977); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405 (1975). In another setting, we have held that a state may employ racial criteria that are reasonably necessary to assure compliance with federal voting rights legislation, even though the state action does not entail the remedy of a constitutional violation. United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 147-165 (1977) (opinion of WHITE, J., joined by BRENNAN, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ.); id., at 180-187 (BURGER, C. J., dissenting on other grounds).\\n\\nWhen we have discussed the remedial powers of a federal court, we have been alert to the limitation that \\u201c[the] power of the federal courts to restructure the operation of local and state governmental entities \\u2018is not plenary. . . .\\u2019 [A] federal court is required to tailor \\u2018the scope of the remedy\\u2019 to fit the nature and extent of the . . . violation.\\u201d Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 419-420 (1977) (quoting Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 738 (1974), and Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra, at 16).\\n\\nHere we deal, as we noted earlier, not with the limited remedial powers of a federal court, for example, but with the broad remedial powers of Congress. It is fundamental that in no organ of government, state or federal, does there repose a more comprehensive remedial power than in the Congress, expressly charged by the Constitution with competence and authority to enforce equal protection guarantees. Congress not only may induce voluntary action to assure compliance [*484] with existing federal statutory or constitutional antidiscrimination provisions, but also, where Congress has authority to declare certain conduct unlawful, it may, as here, authorize and induce state action to avoid such conduct. Supra, at 473-480.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nA more specific challenge to the MBE program is the charge that it impermissibly deprives nonminority businesses of access to at least some portion of the government contracting opportunities generated by the Act. It must be conceded that by its objective of remedying the historical impairment of access, the MBE provision can have the effect of awarding some contracts to MBE\\u2019s which otherwise might be awarded to other businesses, who may themselves be innocent of any prior discriminatory actions. Failure of nonminority firms to receive certain contracts is, of course, an incidental consequence of the program, not part of its objective; similarly, past impairment of minority-firm access to public contracting opportunities may have been an incidental consequence of \\u201cbusiness as usual\\u201d by public contracting agencies and among prime contractors.\\n\\nIt is not a constitutional defect in this program that it may disappoint the expectations of nonminority firms. When effectuating a limited and properly tailored remedy to cure the effects of prior discrimination, such \\u201ca sharing of the burden\\u201d by innocent parties is not impermissible. Franks, supra, at 777; see Albemarle Paper Co., supra; United Jewish Organizations, supra. The actual \\u201cburden\\u201d shouldered by nonminority firms is relatively light in this connection when we consider the scope of this public works program as compared with overall construction contracting opportunities. n72 Moreover, although we may assume that the complaining parties are innocent of any discriminatory conduct, it was within congressional power to act on the assumption that in the past some nonminority businesses may have reaped competitive benefit over the years from the virtual exclusion of minority firms from these contracting opportunities.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn72 The Court of Appeals relied upon Department of Commerce statistics to calculate that the $ 4.2 billion in federal grants conditioned upon compliance with the MBE provision amounted to about 2.5% of the total of nearly $ 170 billion spent on construction in the United States during 1977. Thus, the 10% minimum minority business participation contemplated by this program would account for only 0.25% of the annual expenditure for construction work in the United States. Fullilove v. Kreps, 584 F.2d, at 607.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nAnother challenge to the validity of the MBE program is the assertion that it is underinclusive \\u2014 that it limits its benefit to specified minority groups rather than extending its remedial objectives to all businesses whose access to government contracting is impaired by the effects of disadvantage or discrimination. Such an extension would, of course, be appropriate for Congress to provide; it is not a function for the courts.\\n\\nEven in this context, the well-established concept that a legislature may take one step at a time to remedy only part of a broader problem is not without relevance. See Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471 (1970); Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955). We are not reviewing a federal program that seeks to confer a preferred status upon a nondisadvantaged minority or to give special assistance to only one of several groups established to be similarly disadvantaged minorities. Even in such a setting, the Congress is not without a certain authority. See, e. g., Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979); Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313 (1977); Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535 (1974).\\n\\nThe Congress has not sought to give select minority groups a preferred standing in the construction industry, but has [*486] embarked on a remedial program to place them on a more equitable footing with respect to public contracting opportunities. There has been no showing in this case that Congress has inadvertently effected an invidious discrimination by excluding from coverage an identifiable minority group that has been the victim of a degree of disadvantage and discrimination equal to or greater than that suffered by the groups encompassed by the MBE program. It is not inconceivable that on very special facts a case might be made to challenge the congressional decision to limit MBE eligibility to the particular minority groups identified in the Act. See Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 109-112 (1979); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S., at 240 (opinion of BRENNAN, WHITE, and MARSHALL, JJ.). But on this record we find no basis to hold that Congress is without authority to undertake the kind of limited remedial effort represented by the MBE program. Congress, not the courts, has the heavy burden of dealing with a host of intractable economic and social problems.\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nIt is also contended that the MBE program is overinclusive \\u2014 that it bestows a benefit on businesses identified by racial or ethnic criteria which cannot be justified on the basis of competitive criteria or as a remedy for the present effects of identified prior discrimination. It is conceivable that a particular application of the program may have this effect; however, the peculiarities of specific applications are not before us in this case. We are not presented here with a challenge involving a specific award of a construction contract or the denial of a waiver request; such questions of specific application must await future cases.\\n\\nThis does not mean that the claim of overinclusiveness is entitled to no consideration in the present case. The history of governmental tolerance of practices using racial or ethnic criteria for the purpose or with the effect of imposing an invidious discrimination must alert us to the deleterious effects of even benign racial or ethnic classifications when they stray from narrow remedial justifications. Even in the context of a facial challenge such as is presented in this case, the MBE provision cannot pass muster unless, with due account for its administrative program, it provides a reasonable assurance that application of racial or ethnic criteria will be limited to accomplishing the remedial objectives of Congress and that misapplications of the program will be promptly and adequately remedied administratively.\\n\\nIt is significant that the administrative scheme provides for waiver and exemption. Two fundamental congressional assumptions underlie the MBE program: (1) that the present effects of past discrimination have impaired the competitive position of businesses owned and controlled by members of minority groups; and (2) that affirmative efforts to eliminate barriers to minority-firm access, and to evaluate bids with adjustment for the present effects of past discrimination, would assure that at least 10% of the federal funds granted under the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 would be accounted for by contracts with available, qualified, bona fide minority business enterprises. Each of these assumptions may be rebutted in the administrative process.\\n\\nThe administrative program contains measures to effectuate the congressional objective of assuring legitimate participation by disadvantaged MBE\\u2019s. Administrative definition has tightened some less definite aspects of the statutory identification of the minority groups encompassed by the program. n73 There is administrative scrutiny to identify and eliminate from participation in the program MBE\\u2019s who are not \\u201cbona fide\\u201d within the regulations and guidelines; for example, spurious minority-front entities can be exposed. A significant aspect of this surveillance is the complaint procedure available for reporting \\u201cunjust participation by an enterprise or individuals in the MBE program.\\u201d Supra, at 472. And even as to specific contract awards, waiver is available to avoid dealing with an MBE who is attempting to exploit the remedial aspects of the program by charging an unreasonable price, i. e., a price not attributable to the present effects of past discrimination. Supra, at 469-471. We must assume that Congress intended close scrutiny of false claims and prompt action on them.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn73 The MBE provision, 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 6705 (f)(2) (1976 ed., Supp. II), classifies as a minority business enterprise any \\u201cbusiness at least 50 per centum of which is owned by minority group members or, in the case of a publicly owned business, at least 51 per centum of the stock of which is owned by minority group members.\\u201d Minority group members are defined as \\u201ccitizens of the United States who are Negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts.\\u201d The administrative definitions are set out in the Appendix to this opinion, para. 3. These categories also are classified as minorities in the regulations implementing the nondiscrimination requirements of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, 45 U. S. C. \\u00a7 803, see 49 CFR \\u00a7 265.5 (i) (1978), on which Congress relied as precedent for the MBE provision. See 123 Cong. Rec. 7156 (1977) (remarks of Sen. Brooke). The House Subcommittee on SBA Oversight and Minority Enterprise, whose activities played a significant part in the legislative history of the MBE provision, also recognized that these categories were included within the Federal Government\\u2019s definition of \\u201cminority business enterprise.\\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 94-468, pp. 20-21 (1975). The specific inclusion of these groups in the MBE provision demonstrates that Congress concluded they were victims of discrimination. Petitioners did not press any challenge to Congress\\u2019 classification categories in the Court of Appeals; there is no reason for this Court to pass upon the issue at this time.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nGrantees are given the opportunity to demonstrate that their best efforts will not succeed or have not succeeded in achieving the statutory 10% target for minority firm participation within the limitations of the program\\u2019s remedial objectives. In these circumstances a waiver or partial waiver is available once compliance has been demonstrated. A waiver may be sought and granted at any time during the contracting process, or even prior to letting contracts if the facts warrant.\\n\\nNor is the program defective because a waiver may be sought only by the grantee and not by prime contractors who may experience difficulty in fulfilling contract obligations to assure minority participation. It may be administratively cumbersome, but the wisdom of concentrating responsibility at the grantee level is not for us to evaluate; the purpose is to allow the EDA to maintain close supervision of the operation of the MBE provision. The administrative complaint mechanism allows for grievances of prime contractors who assert that a grantee has failed to seek a waiver in an appropriate case. Finally, we note that where private parties, as opposed to governmental entities, transgress the limitations inherent in the MBE program, the possibility of constitutional violation is more removed. See Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 200 (1979).\\n\\nThat the use of racial and ethnic criteria is premised on assumptions rebuttable in the administrative process gives reasonable assurance that application of the MBE program will be limited to accomplishing the remedial objectives contemplated by Congress and that misapplications of the racial and ethnic criteria can be remedied. In dealing with this facial challenge to the statute, doubts must be resolved in support of the congressional judgment that this limited program is a necessary step to effectuate the constitutional mandate for equality of economic opportunity. The MBE provision may be viewed as a pilot project, appropriately limited in extent and duration, and subject to reassessment and re-evaluation by the Congress prior to any extension or re-enactment. n74 Miscarriages of administration could have only a transitory economic impact on businesses not encompassed by the program, and would not be irremediable.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn74 Cf.

In this effort, Congress has necessary latitude to try new techniques such as the limited use of racial and ethnic criteria to accomplish remedial objectives; this is especially so in programs where voluntary cooperation with remedial measures is induced by placing conditions on federal expenditures. That the program may press the outer limits of congressional authority affords no basis for striking it down.\\n\\nPetitioners have mounted a facial challenge to a program developed by the politically responsive branches of Government. For its part, the Congress must proceed only with programs narrowly tailored to achieve its objectives, subject to continuing evaluation and reassessment; administration of the programs must be vigilant and flexible; and, when such a program comes under judicial review, courts must be satisfied that the legislative objectives and projected administration give reasonable assurance that the program will function within constitutional limitations. But as Mr. Justice Jackson admonished in a different context in 1941: n75\\n\\n\\u201cThe Supreme Court can maintain itself and succeed in its tasks only if the counsels of self-restraint urged most earnestly by members of the Court itself are humbly and faithfully heeded. After the forces of conservatism and liberalism, of radicalism and reaction, of emotion and of self-interest are all caught up in the legislative process and averaged and come to rest in some compromise measure such as the Missouri Compromise, the N.R.A., the A.A.A., a minimum-wage law, or some other legislative policy, a decision striking it down closes an area of compromise in which conflicts have actually, if only temporarily, been composed. Each such decision takes away from our democratic federalism another of its defenses against domestic disorder and violence. The vice of judicial supremacy, as exerted for ninety years in the field of policy, has been its progressive closing of the avenues to peaceful and democratic conciliation of our social and economic conflicts.\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Justice Jackson reiterated these thoughts shortly before his death in what was to be the last of his Godkin Lectures: n76\\n\\n\\u201cI have said that in these matters the Court must respect the limitations on its own powers because judicial usurpation is to me no more justifiable and no more promising of permanent good to the country than any other kind. So I presuppose a Court that will not depart from the judicial process, will not go beyond resolving cases and controversies brought to it in conventional form, and will not consciously encroach upon the functions of its coordinate branches.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn75 R.

This case is one which requires, and which has received, that kind of examination. This opinion does not adopt, either expressly or implicitly, the formulas of analysis articulated in such cases as University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). However, our analysis demonstrates that the MBE provision would survive judicial review under either \\u201ctest\\u201d articulated in the several Bakke opinions.

J.\\n\\nPM1. The EDA Guidelines, at 2-7, provide in relevant part:\\n\\n\\u201cThe primary obligation for carrying out the 10% MBE participation requirement rests with EDA Grantees. . . . The Grantee and those of its contractors which will make subcontracts or purchase substantial supplies from other firms (hereinafter referred to as \\u2018prime contractors\\u2019) must seek out all available bona fide MBE\\u2019s and make every effort to use as many of them as possible on the project.\\n\\n\\u201cAn MBE is bona fide if the minority group ownership interests are real and continuing and not created solely to meet 10% MBE requirements. For example, the minority group owners or stockholders should possess control over management, interest in capital and interest in earnings commensurate with the percentage of ownership [*493] on which the claim of minority ownership status is based. . . .\\n\\n\\u201cAn MBE is available if the project is located in the market area of the MBE and the MBE can perform project services or supply project materials at the time they are needed. The relevant market area depends on the kind of services or supplies which are needed. . . . EDA will require that Grantees and prime contractors engage MBE\\u2019s from as wide a market area as is economically feasible.\\n\\n\\u201cAn MBE is qualified if it can perform the services or supply the materials that are needed. Grantees and prime contractors will be expected to use MBE\\u2019s with less experience than available nonminority enterprises and should expect to provide technical assistance to MBE\\u2019s as needed. Inability to obtain bonding will ordinarily not disqualify an MBE. Grantees and prime contractors are expected to help MBE\\u2019s obtain bonding, to include MBE\\u2019s in any overall bond or to waive bonding where feasible. The Small Business Administration (SBA) is prepared to provide a 90% guarantee for the bond of any MBE participating in an LPW [local public works] project. Lack of working capital will not ordinarily disqualify an MBE. SBA is prepared to provide working capital assistance to any MBE participating in an LPW project. Grantees and prime contractors are expected to assist MBE\\u2019s in obtaining working capital through SBA or otherwise.\\n\\n\\u201c. . . [Every] Grantee should make sure that it knows the names, addresses and qualifications of all relevant MBE\\u2019s which would include the project location in their market areas. . . . Grantees should also hold prebid conferences to which they invite interested contractors and representatives of . . . MBE support organizations.\\n\\n\\u201cArrangements have been made through the Office of Minority Business Enterprise . . . to provide assistance [*494] to Grantees and prime contractors in fulfilling the 10% MBE requirement. . . .\\n\\n\\u201cGrantees and prime contractors should also be aware of other support which is available from the Small Business Administration. . . .\\n\\n\\u201c. . . [The] Grantee must monitor the performance of its prime contractors to make sure that their commitments to expend funds for MBE\\u2019s are being fulfilled. . . . Grantees should administer every project tightly. . . .\\u201d\\n\\nPM 2. The EDA guidelines, at 13-15, provide in relevant part:\\n\\n\\u201cAlthough a provision for waiver is included under this section of the Act, EDA will only approve a waiver under exceptional circumstances. The Grantee must demonstrate that there are not sufficient, relevant, qualified minority business enterprises whose market areas include the project location to justify a waiver. The Grantee must detail in its waiver request the efforts the Grantee and potential contractors have exerted to locate and enlist MBE\\u2019s. The request must indicate the specific MBE\\u2019s which were contacted and the reason each MBE was not used. . . .\\n\\n. . . .\\n\\n\\u201cOnly the Grantee can request a waiver. . . . Such a waiver request would ordinarily be made after the initial bidding or negotiation procedures proved unsuccessful. . . .\\n. . . .\\n\\n\\u201c[A] Grantee situated in an area where the minority population is very small may apply for a waiver before requesting bids on its project or projects. . . .\\u201d\\n\\nPM 3. The EDA Technical Bulletin, at 1, provides the following definitions:\\n\\n\\u201ca) Negro \\u2014 An individual of the black race of African origin.\\n\\n\\u201cb) Spanish-speaking \\u2014 An individual of a Spanish-speaking culture and origin or parentage.\\n\\n\\u201cc) Oriental \\u2014 An individual of a culture, origin or parentage traceable to the areas south of the Soviet Union, East of Iran, inclusive of islands adjacent thereto, and out to the Pacific including but not limited to Indonesia, Indochina, Malaysia, Hawaii and the Philippines.\\n\\n\\u201cd) Indian \\u2014 An individual having origins in any of the original people of North America and who is recognized as an Indian by either a tribe, tribal organization or a suitable authority in the community. (A suitable authority in the community may be: educational institutions, religious organizations, or state agencies.)\\n\\n\\u201ce) Eskimo \\u2014 An individual having origins in any of the original peoples of Alaska.\\n\\n\\u201cf) Aleut \\u2014 An individual having origins in any of the original peoples of the Aleutian Islands.\\u201d\\n\\nPM 4. The EDA Technical Bulletin, at 19, provides in relevant part:\\n\\n\\u201cAny person or organization with information indicating unjust participation by an enterprise or individuals in the MBE program or who believes that the MBE participation requirement is being improperly applied should contact the appropriate EDA grantee and provide a detailed statement of the basis for the complaint.\\n\\n\\u201cUpon receipt of a complaint, the grantee should attempt to resolve the issues in dispute. In the event the grantee requires assistance in reaching a determination, the grantee should contact the Civil Rights Specialist in the appropriate Regional Office.\\n\\n\\u201cIf the complainant believes that the grantee has not satisfactorily resolved the issues raised in his complaint, he may personally contact the EDA Regional Office.\\u201d\\n\\nCONCUR BY: POWELL; MARSHALL\\n\\nCONCUR: MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.\\n\\nAlthough I would place greater emphasis than THE CHIEF JUSTICE on the need to articulate judicial standards of review in conventional terms, I view his opinion announcing the judgment as substantially in accord with my own views. Accordingly, I join that opinion and write separately to apply the analysis set forth by my opinion in University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978) (hereinafter Bakke).\\n\\nThe question in this case is whether Congress may enact the requirement in \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 (PWEA), that 10% of federal grants for local public work projects funded by the Act be set aside for minority business enterprises. Section 103 (f)(2) employs a racial classification that is constitutionally prohibited unless it is a necessary means of advancing a compelling governmental interest. Bakke, supra, at 299, 305; see In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717, 721-722 (1973); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11 (1967); McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 196 (1964). For the reason stated in my Bakke opinion, I consider adherence to this standard as important and consistent with precedent.\\n\\nThe Equal Protection Clause, and the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, demand that any governmental distinction among groups must be justifiable. Different standards of review applied to different sorts of classifications simply illustrate the principle that some classifications are less likely to be legitimate than others. Racial classifications must be assessed under the most stringent level of review because immutable characteristics, which bear no relation to individual merit or need, are irrelevant to almost every governmental decision. See, e. g., Anderson v. Martin, 375 U.S. 399, 402-404 (1964). In this case, however, I believe that \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) is justified as a remedy that serves the compelling governmental interest in eradicating the continuing effects of past discrimination identified by Congress. n1\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn1 Although racial classifications require strict judicial scrutiny, I do not agree that the Constitution prohibits all racial classification. MR. JUSTICE STEWART recognizes the principle that I believe is applicable: \\u201cUnder our Constitution, any official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect and presumptively invalid.\\u201d Post, at 523. But, in narrowly defined circumstances, that presumption may be rebutted. Cf. Lee v. Washington, 390 U.S. 333, 334 (1968) (Black, Harlan, and STEWART, JJ., concurring).\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nI\\n\\nRacial preference never can constitute a compelling state interest. \\u201c\\u2018Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry\\u2019 [are] \\u2018odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.'\\u201d Loving v. Virginia, supra, at 11, quoting Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100 (1943). Thus, if the set-aside merely expresses a congressional desire to prefer one racial or ethnic group over another, \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) violates the equal protection component in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954).\\n\\nThe Government does have a legitimate interest in ameliorating the disabling effects of identified discrimination. Bakke, supra, at 307; see, e. g., Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colo., 413 U.S. 189, 236 (1973) (POWELL, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U.S. 39, 41 (1971); North Carolina Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 45-46 (1971); Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 437-438 (1968). The existence of illegal discrimination justifies the imposition of a remedy that will \\u201cmake persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful . . . discrimination.\\u201d Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 418 (1975). A critical inquiry, therefore, is whether \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) was enacted as a means of redressing such discrimination. But this Court has never approved race-conscious remedies absent judicial, administrative, or legislative findings of constitutional or statutory violations. Bakke, supra, at 307; see, e. g., Teamsters v. United [*498] States, 431 U.S. 324, 367-376 (1977); United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 155-159 (1977) (opinion of WHITE, J.); South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 308-315 (1966).\\n\\nBecause the distinction between permissible remedial action and impermissible racial preference rests on the existence of a constitutional or statutory violation, the legitimate interest in creating a race-conscious remedy is not compelling unless an appropriate governmental authority has found that such a violation has occurred. In other words, two requirements must be met. First, the governmental body that attempts to impose a race-conscious remedy must have the authority to act in response to identified discrimination. Cf. Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 103 (1976). Second, the governmental body must make findings that demonstrate the existence of illegal discrimination. In Bakke, the Regents failed both requirements. They were entrusted only with educational functions, and they made no findings of past discrimination. Thus, no compelling governmental interest was present to justify the use of a racial quota in medical school admissions. Bakke, supra, at 309-310.\\n\\nOur past cases also establish that even if the government proffers a compelling interest to support reliance upon a suspect classification, the means selected must be narrowly drawn to fulfill the governmental purpose. In re Griffiths, supra, at 721-722. In Bakke, for example, the state university did have a compelling interest in the attainment of a diverse student body. But the method selected to achieve that end, the use of a fixed admissions quota, was not appropriate. The Regents\\u2019 quota system eliminated some nonminority applicants from all consideration for a specified number of seats in the entering class, although it allowed minority applicants to compete for all available seats. 438 U.S., at 275-276. In contrast, an admissions program that recognizes race as a factor, but not the sole factor, in assessing an applicant\\u2019s qualifications serves the university\\u2019s interest in diversity while ensuring that each applicant receives fair and competitive consideration. Id., at 317-318.\\n\\nIn reviewing the constitutionality of \\u00a7 103 (f)(2), we must decide: (i) whether Congress is competent to make findings of unlawful discrimination; (ii) if so, whether sufficient findings have been made to establish that unlawful discrimination has affected adversely minority business enterprises, and (iii) whether the 10% set-aside is a permissible means for redressing identifiable past discrimination. None of these questions may be answered without explicit recognition that we are reviewing an Act of Congress.\\n\\nII\\n\\nThe history of this Court\\u2019s review of congressional action demonstrates beyond question that the National Legislature is competent to find constitutional and statutory violations. Unlike the Regents of the University of California, Congress properly may \\u2014 and indeed must \\u2014 address directly the problems of discrimination in our society. See Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 257 (1964). In Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 304 (1964), for example, this Court held that Congress had the power under the Commerce Clause to prohibit racial discrimination in public restaurants on the basis of its \\u201c[findings] that [such discrimination] had a direct and adverse effect on the free flow of interstate commerce.\\u201d\\n\\nSimilarly, after hearing \\u201coverwhelming\\u201d evidence of private employment discrimination, see H. R. Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, p. 26 (1963), Congress enacted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in order \\u201cto assure equality of employment opportunities and to eliminate those discriminatory practices and devices which have fostered racially stratified job environments to the disadvantage of minority citizens.\\u201d McDonnell Douglas Corp . v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800 (1973). Acting to further the purposes of Title VII Congress vested in the federal courts broad equitable discretion to ensure that \\u201c\\u2018persons aggrieved by the consequences and effects of the unlawful employment practice be, so far as possible, restored to a position where they would have been were it not for the unlawful discrimination.'\\u201d Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 764 (1976), quoting Section-by-Section Analysis of H. R. 1746, accompanying the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 \\u2014 Conference Report, 118 Cong. Rec. 7166, 7168 (1972).\\n\\nIn addition, Congress has been given the unique constitutional power of legislating to enforce the provisions of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. n2 At an early date, the Court stated that \\u201c[it] is the power of Congress which has been enlarged\\u201d by the enforcement provisions of the post-Civil War Amendments. Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 345 (1880). In Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer & Co., 392 U.S. 409, 441-443 (1968), the Court recognized Congress\\u2019 competence to determine that private action inhibiting the right to acquire and convey real property was racial discrimination forbidden by the Thirteenth Amendment. Subsequently, we held that Congress\\u2019 enactment of 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1981 pursuant to its powers under the Thirteenth Amendment, see Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 168-170, 179 (1976), provides to all persons a federal remedy for racial discrimination in private employment. See McDonald v. Sante Fe Transportation Co., 427 U.S. 273, 295-296 (1976); Johnson v. Railway Express Agency Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 459-460 (1975).\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn2 Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, provides that \\u201cCongress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\\u201d In virtually identical language, \\u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and \\u00a7 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment give Congress the power to enforce the provisions of those Amendments.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nIn Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966), the Court considered whether \\u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment gave Congress the power to enact \\u00a7 4 (e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1973b (e). Section 4 (e) provides that no person educated in Puerto Rico may be denied the right to vote in any election for failure to read or write the English language. The Court held that Congress was empowered to enact \\u00a7 4 (e) as a remedy for discrimination against the Puerto Rican community. 384 U.S., at 652-653. Implicit in its holding was the Court\\u2019s belief that Congress had the authority to find, and had found, that members of this minority group had suffered governmental discrimination.\\n\\nCongress\\u2019 authority to find and provide for the redress of constitutional violations also has been confirmed in cases construing the Enforcement Clause of the Fifteenth Amendment. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S., at 308, for example, the Court upheld the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1973 et seq., as an appropriate remedy for violations of the Fifteenth Amendment. It noted that Congress had found \\u201cinsidious and pervasive\\u201d discrimination demanding \\u201c[stern] and . . . elaborate\\u201d measures. 383 U.S., at 309. Most relevant to our present inquiry was the Court\\u2019s express approval of Congress\\u2019 decision to \\u201c[prescribe] remedies for voting discrimination which go into effect without the need for prior adjudication.\\u201d Id., at 327-328. n3\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nN3 Among the remedies approved in South Carolina v. Katzenbach was the temporary suspension of literacy tests in some jurisdictions. The Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1973aa et seq., temporarily banned the use of literacy tests in all jurisdictions In Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970), this Court, speaking through five separate opinions, unanimously upheld that action as a proper exercise of Congress\\u2019 authority under the post-Civil War Amendments. See id., at 117 (Black, J.); id., at 135 (Douglas, J.); id., at 152 (Harlan, J.); id., at 229 (BRENNAN, WHITE, and MARSHALL, JJ.); id., at 281 (STEWART, J., with whom BURGER, C. J. and BLACKMUN, J., concurred). MR. JUSTICE STEWART said:\\n\\n\\u201cCongress was not required to make state-by-state findings concerning . . . actual impact of literacy requirements on the Negro citizen\\u2019s access to the ballot box. In the interests of uniformity, Congress may paint with a much broader brush than may this Court, which must confine itself to the judicial function of deciding individual cases and controversies upon individual records. The findings that Congress made when it enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 would have supported a nationwide ban on literacy tests.\\u201d Id., at 284 (citation omitted).\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nIt is beyond question, therefore, that Congress has the authority to identify unlawful discriminatory practices, to prohibit those practices, and to prescribe remedies to eradicate their continuing effects. The next inquiry is whether Congress has made findings adequate to support its determination that minority contractors have suffered extensive discrimination.\\n\\nIII\\n\\nA\\n\\nThe petitioners contend that the legislative history of \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) reflects no congressional finding of statutory or constitutional violations. Crucial to that contention is the assertion that a reviewing court may not look beyond the legislative history of the PWEA itself for evidence that Congress believed it was combating invidious discrimination. But petitioners\\u2019 theory would erect an artificial barrier to full understanding of the legislative process.\\n\\nCongress is not an adjudicatory body called upon to resolve specific disputes between competing adversaries. Its constitutional role is to be representative rather than impartial, to make policy rather than to apply settled principles of law. The petitioners\\u2019 contention that this Court should treat the debates on \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) as the complete \\u201crecord\\u201d of congressional decisionmaking underlying that statute is essentially a plea that we treat Congress as if it were a lower federal court. But Congress is not expected to act as though it were duty bound to find facts and make conclusions of law. The creation of national rules for the governance of our society simply does not entail the same concept of recordmaking that is appropriate to a judicial or administrative proceeding. Congress has no responsibility to confine its vision to the facts and evidence adduced by particular parties. Instead, its special attribute as a legislative body lies in its broader mission to investigate and consider all facts and opinions that may be relevant to the resolution of an issue. One appropriate source is the information and expertise that Congress acquires in the consideration and enactment of earlier legislation. After Congress has legislated repeatedly in an area of national concern, its Members gain experience that may reduce the need for fresh hearings or prolonged debate when Congress again considers action in that area.\\n\\nAcceptance of petitioners\\u2019 argument would force Congress to make specific factual findings with respect to each legislative action. Such a requirement would mark an unprecedented imposition of adjudicatory procedures upon a coordinate branch of Government. Neither the Constitution nor our democratic tradition warrants such a constraint on the legislative process. I therefore conclude that we are not confined in this case to an examination of the legislative history of \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) alone. Rather, we properly may examine the total contemporary record of congressional action dealing with the problems of racial discrimination against minority business enterprises.\\n\\nB\\n\\nIn my view, the legislative history of \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) demonstrates that Congress reasonably concluded that private and governmental discrimination had contributed to the negligible percentage of public contracts awarded minority contractors. n4 [*504] The opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE provides a careful overview of the relevant legislative history, see ante, at 456-467, to which only a few words need be added.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn4 I cannot accept the suggestion of the Court of Appeals that \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) must be viewed as serving a compelling state interest if the reviewing court can \\u201cperceive a basis\\u201d for legislative action. Fullilove v. Kreps, 584 F.2d 600, 604-605 (1978), quoting Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 656 (1966). The \\u201cperceive a basis\\u201d standard refers to congressional authority to act, not to the distinct question whether that action violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\\n\\nIn my view, a court should uphold a reasonable congressional finding of discrimination. A more stringent standard of review would impinge upon Congress\\u2019 ability to address problems of discrimination, see supra, at 500-503; a standard requiring a court to \\u201cperceive a basis\\u201d is essentially meaningless in this context. Such a test might allow a court to justify legislative action even in the absence of affirmative evidence of congressional findings.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nSection 103 (f)(2) originated in an amendment introduced on the floor of the House of Representatives by Representative Mitchell. Congressman Mitchell noted that the Federal Government was already operating a set-aside program under \\u00a7 8 (a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U. S. C. \\u00a7 637 (a). He described his proposal as \\u201cthe only sensible way for us to begin to develop a viable economic system for minorities in this country, with the ultimate result being that we are going to eventually be able to . . . end certain programs which are merely support survival programs for people which do not contribute to the economy.\\u201d 123 Cong. Rec. 5327 (1977). n5 Senator Brooke, who introduced a similar measure in the Senate, reminded the Senate of the special provisions previously enacted into \\u00a7 8 (a) of the Small Business Act and the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 149, 49 U.

The Small Business Administration has been directed by Executive Order to employ \\u00a7 8 (a) to aid socially and economically disadvantaged persons. Ante, at 463-464. n6 The operation of the \\u00a7 8 (a) program was reviewed by congressional Committees between 1972 and 1977. In 1972, the House Subcommittee on Minority Small Business Enterprise found that minority businessmen face economic difficulties that \\u201care the result of past social standards which linger as characteristics of minorities as a group.\\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 92-1615, p. 3 (1972). In 1975, the House Subcommittee on SBA Oversight and Minority Enterprise concluded that \\u201c[the] effect of past inequities stemming from racial prejudice have not remained in the past,\\u201d and that low participation by minorities in the economy was the result of \\u201cpast discriminatory practices.\\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 94-468, pp. 1-2 (1975). In 1977, the House Committee on Small Business found that\\n\\n\\u201cover the years, there has developed a business system which has traditionally excluded measurable minority participation. In the past more than the present, this system of conducting business transactions overtly precluded minority input. Currently, we more often encounter a business system which is racially neutral on its face, but because of past overt social and economic discrimination is presently operating, in effect, to perpetuate these past inequities.\\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 94-1791, p. 182 (1977).\\n\\nThe Committee\\u2019s Report was issued on January 3, 1977, less than two months before Representative Mitchell introduced \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) into the House of Representatives. n7\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn6 In 1969, 1970, and 1971, the President issued Executive Orders directing federal aid for minority business enterprises. See Exec. Order No. 11458, 3 CFR 779 (1966-1970 Comp.); Exec. Order No. 11518, 3 CFR 907 (1966-1970 Comp.); Exec. Order No. 11625, 3 CFR 616 (1971-1975 Comp.). The President noted that \\u201cmembers of certain minority groups through no fault of their own have been denied the full opportunity to [participate in the free enterprise system],\\u201d Exec. Order No. 11518, 3 CFR 908 (1966-1970 Comp.), and that the \\u201copportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by socially and economically disadvantaged persons is essential if we are to obtain social and economic justice.\\u201d Exec. Order No. 11625, 3 CFR 616 (1971-1975 Comp.). Assistance to minority business enterprises through the \\u00a7 8 (a) program has been designed to promote the goals of these Executive Orders. Ray Baillie Trash Hauling, Inc. v. Kleppe, 477 F.2d 696, 706 (CA5 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 914 (1974).\\n\\nn7 Two sections of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act also reflect Congress\\u2019 recognition of the need for remedial steps on behalf of minority businesses. Section 905, 45 U. S. C. \\u00a7 803, prohibits discrimination in any activity funded by the Act, and \\u00a7 906, 49 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1657a, establishes a Minority Resource Center to assist minority businessmen to obtain contracts and business opportunities related to the maintenance and rehabilitation of railroads. The provisions were enacted by a Congress that recognized the \\u201cestablished national policy, since at least the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to encourage and assist in the development of minority business enterprise.\\u201d S. Rep. No. 94-499, p. 44 (1975) (Commerce Committee). In January 1977, the Department of Transportation issued regulations pursuant to 45 U. S. C. \\u00a7 803 (d) that require contractors to formulate affirmative-action programs to ensure that minority businesses receive a fair proportion of contract opportunities. See 49 CFR \\u00a7\\u00a7 265.9-265.17 (1978). See also nn. 11 and 12, infra.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nIn light of these legislative materials and the discussion of legislative history contained in THE CHIEF JUSTICE\\u2019s opinion, I believe that a court must accept as established the conclusion that purposeful discrimination contributed significantly to the small percentage of federal contracting funds that minority business enterprises have received. Refusals to subcontract work to minority contractors may, depending upon the identity of the discriminating party, violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 2000d et seq., or 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1981, or the Fourteenth Amendment. Although the discriminatory activities were not identified with the exactitude expected in judicial or administrative adjudication, it must be remembered that \\u201cCongress may paint with a much broader brush than may this Court. . . .\\u201d Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 284 (1970) (STEWART, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). n8\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn8 Although this record suffices to support the congressional judgment that minority contractors suffered identifiable discrimination, Congress need not be content with findings that merely meet constitutional standards. Race-conscious remedies, popularly referred to as affirmative-action programs, almost invariably affect some innocent persons. See infra, at 514. Respect and support for the law, especially in an area as sensitive as this, depend in large measure upon the public\\u2019s perception of fairness. See Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 319, n. 53 (1978); J. Wilkinson, From Brown to Bakke 264-266 (1979); Perry, Modern Equal Protection: A Conceptualization and Appraisal, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 1023, 1048-1049 (1979). It therefore is important that the legislative record supporting race-conscious remedies contain evidence that satisfies fairminded people that the congressional action is just.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\nIV\\n\\nUnder this Court\\u2019s established doctrine, a racial classification is suspect and subject to strict judicial scrutiny. As noted in Part I, the government may employ such a classification only when necessary to accomplish a compelling governmental purpose. See Bakke, 438 U.S., at 305. The conclusion that Congress found a compelling governmental interest in redressing identified discrimination against minority contractors therefore leads to the inquiry whether use of a 10% set-aside is a constitutionally appropriate means of serving that interest. In the past, this \\u201cmeans\\u201d test has been virtually impossible to satisfy. Only two of this Court\\u2019s modern cases have held the use of racial classifications to be constitutional. See Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944); Hirabayshi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81 (1943). Indeed, the failure of legislative action to survive strict scrutiny has led some to wonder whether our review of racial classifications has been strict in theory, but fatal in fact. See Gunther, The Supreme Court, 1971 Term \\u2014 Foreword: In Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for a Newer Equal Protection, 86 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 8 (1972).\\n\\nA\\n\\nApplication of the \\u201cmeans\\u201d test necessarily demands an understanding of the type of congressional action at issue. This is not a case in which Congress has employed a racial classification solely as a means to confer a racial preference. Such a purpose plainly would be unconstitutional. Supra, at 497. Nor has Congress sought to employ a racially conscious means to further a nonracial goal. In such instances, a nonracial means should be available to further the legitimate governmental purpose. See Bakke, supra, at 310-311.\\n\\nEnactment of the set-aside is designed to serve the compelling governmental interest in redressing racial discrimination. As this Court has recognized, the implementation of any affirmative remedy for redress of racial discrimination is likely to affect persons differently depending upon their race. See, e. g., North Carolina Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U.S., at 45-46. Although federal courts may not order or approve remedies that exceed the scope of a constitutional violation, see Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 280-281 (1977); Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406 (1977); Austin Independent School District v. United States, 429 U.S. 990, 991 (1976) (POWELL, J., concurring), this Court has not required remedial plans to be limited to the least restrictive means of implementation. We have recognized that the choice of remedies to redress racial discrimination is \\u201ca balancing process left, within appropriate constitutional or statutory limits, to the sound discretion of the trial court.\\u201d Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S., at 794 (POWELL, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\\n\\nI believe that the Enforcement Clauses of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments give Congress a similar measure of discretion to choose a suitable remedy for the redress of racial discrimination. The legislative history of \\u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment is particularly instructive. Senator Howard, the member of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction who introduced the Amendment into the Senate, described \\u00a7 5 as \\u201ca direct affirmative delegation of power to Congress to carry out all the principles of all [the] guarantees\\u201d of \\u00a7 1 of the Amendment. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2766 (1866). Furthermore, he stated that \\u00a7 5\\n\\n\\u201ccasts upon the Congress the responsibility of seeing to it, for the future, that all the sections of the amendment are carried out in good faith, and that no State infringes the rights of persons or property. I look upon this clause as indispensable for the reason that it thus imposes upon the Congress this power and this duty.\\u201d Id., at 2768.\\n\\nSenator Howard\\u2019s emphasis on the importance of congressional action to effectuate the goals of the Fourteenth Amendment was echoed by other Members of Congress. Representative Stevens, also a member of the Reconstruction Committee, said that the Fourteenth Amendment \\u201callows Congress to correct the unjust legislation of the States,\\u201d id., at 2459, and Senator Poland wished to leave no doubt \\u201cas to the power of Congress to enforce principles lying at the very foundation of all republican government. . . .\\u201d Id., at 2961.

Fairman, History of the Supreme Court of the United States: Reconstruction and Reunion, Part 1, pp. 1295, 1296 (1971), they did not believe that congressional action would be unreviewable by this Court. Several Members of Congress emphasized that a primary purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to place the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \\u201cin the eternal firmament of the Constitution.\\u201d Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2462 (1866) (remarks of Rep. Garfield). See id., at 2459 (remarks of Rep. Stevens); id., at 2465 (remarks of Rep. Thayer); id., at 2498 (remarks of Rep. Broomall). By 1866, Members of Congress fully understood that judicial review was the means by which action of the Legislative and Executive Branches would be required to conform to the Constitution. See, e. g., Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803).\\n\\nI conclude, therefore, that the Enforcement Clauses of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments confer upon Congress the authority to select reasonable remedies to advance the compelling state interest in repairing the effects of discrimination. But that authority must be exercised in a manner that does not erode the guarantees of these Amendments. The Judicial Branch has the special responsibility to make a searching inquiry into the justification for employing a race-conscious remedy. Courts must be sensitive to the possibility that less intrusive means might serve the compelling state interest equally as well. I believe that Congress\\u2019 choice of a remedy should be upheld, however, if the means selected are equitable and reasonably necessary to the redress of identified discrimination. Such a test allows the Congress to exercise necessary discretion but preserves the essential safeguard of judicial review of racial classifications.\\n\\nB\\n\\nWhen reviewing the selection by Congress of a race-conscious remedy, it is instructive to note the factors upon which the Courts of Appeals have relied in a closely analogous area. Courts reviewing the proper scope of race-conscious hiring remedies have considered (i) the efficacy of alternative remedies, NAACP v. Allen, 493 F.2d 614, 619 (CA5 1974); Vulcan Society, Inc. v. Civil Service Comm\\u2019n, 490 F.2d 387, 398 (CA2 1973), (ii) the planned duration of the remedy, id., at 399; United States v. Wood, Wire & Metal Lathers Local 46, 471 F.2d 408, 414, n. 12 (CA2), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 939 (1973), (iii) the relationship between the percentage of minority workers to be employed and the percentage of minority group members in the relevant population or work force, Association Against Discrimination v. Bridgeport, 594 F.2d 306, 311 (CA2 1979); Boston Chapter NAACP v. Beecher, 504 F.2d 1017, 1026-1027 (CA1 1974), cert. denied, [*511] 421 U.S. 910 (1975); Bridgeport Guardians, Inc. v.

Gallagher, 452 F.2d 315, 331 (CA8) (en banc), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 950 (1972), and (iv) the availability of waiver provisions if the hiring plan could not be met, Associated General Contractors, Inc. v. Altshuler, 490 F.2d 9, 18-19 (CA1 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 957 (1974).\\n\\nBy the time Congress enacted \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) in 1977, it knew that other remedies had failed to ameliorate the effects of racial discrimination in the construction industry. Although the problem had been addressed by antidiscrimination legislation, executive action to remedy employment discrimination in the construction industry, and federal aid to minority businesses, the fact remained that minority contractors were receiving less than 1% of federal contracts. See 123 Cong. Rec. 7156 (1977) (remarks of Sen. Brooke). Congress also knew that economic recession threatened the construction industry as a whole. Section 103 (f)(2) was enacted as part of a bill designed to stimulate the economy by appropriating $ 4 billion in federal funds for new public construction. Since the emergency public construction funds were to be distributed quickly, n10 any remedial provision designed to prevent those funds from perpetuating past discrimination also had to be effective promptly. Moreover, Congress understood that any effective remedial program had to provide minority contractors the experience necessary for continued success without federal assistance. n11 And Congress knew that the ability of minority group members to gain experience had been frustrated by the difficulty of entering the construction trades. n12 The set-aside program adopted as part of this emergency [*513] legislation serves each of these concerns because it takes effect as soon as funds are expended under PWEA and because it provides minority contractors with experience that could enable them to compete without governmental assistance.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn10 The PWEA provides that federal moneys be committed to state and local grantees by September 30, 1977. 42 U.

Action on applications for funds was to be taken within 60 days after receipt of the application, \\u00a7 6706, and on-site work was to begin within 90 days of project approval, \\u00a7 6705 (d).\\n\\nn11 In 1972, a congressional oversight Committee addressed the \\u201ccomplex problem \\u2014 how to achieve economic prosperity despite a long history of racial bias.\\u201d See H. R. Rep. No. 92-1615, p. 3 (1972) (Select Committee on Small Business). The Committee explained how the effects of discrimination translate into economic barriers:\\n\\n\\u201cIn attempting to increase their participation as entrepreneurs in our economy, the minority businessman usually encounters several major problems. These problems, which are economic in nature, are the result of past social standards which linger as characteristics of minorities as a group.\\n\\n\\u201cThe minority entrepreneur is faced initially with the lack of capital, the most serious problem of all beginning minorities or other entrepreneurs. Because minorities as a group are not traditionally holders of large amounts of capital, the entrepreneur must go outside his community in order to obtain the needed capital. Lending firms require substantial security and a track record in order to lend funds, security which the minority businessmen usually cannot provide. Because he cannot produce either, he is often turned down.\\n\\n. . . .\\n\\n\\u201cFunctional expertise is a necessity for the successful operation of any enterprise. Minorities have traditionally assumed the role of the labor force in business with few gaining access to positions whereby they could learn not only the physical operation of the enterprise, but also the internal functions of management.\\u201d Id., at 3-4.\\n\\nn12 When Senator Brooke introduced the PWEA set-aside in the Senate, he stated that aid to minority businesses also would help to alleviate problems of minority unemployment. 123 Cong. Rec. 7156 (1977). Congress had considered the need to remedy employment discrimination in the construction industry when it refused to override the \\u201cPhiladelphia Plan.\\u201d The \\u201cPhiladelphia Plan,\\u201d promulgated by the Department of Labor in 1969, required all federal contractors to use hiring goals in order to redress past discrimination. See Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania v. Secretary of Labor, 442 F.2d 159, 163 (CA3), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 854 (1971). Later that year, the House of Representatives refused to adopt an amendment to an appropriations bill that would have had the effect of overruling the Labor Department\\u2019s order. 115 Cong. Rec. 40921 (1969). The Senate, which had approved such an amendment, then voted to recede from its position. Id., at 40749.\\n\\nDuring the Senate debate, several legislators argued that implementation of the Philadelphia Plan was necessary to ensure equal opportunity. See id., at 40740 (remarks of Sen. Scott); id., at 40741 (remarks of Sen. Griffith); id., at 40744 (remarks of Sen. Bayh). Senator Percy argued that the Plan was needed to redress discrimination against blacks in the construction industry. Id., at 40742-40743. The day following the Senate vote to recede from its earlier position, Senator Kennedy noted \\u201cexceptionally blatant\\u201d racial discrimination in the construction trades. He commended the Senate\\u2019s decision that \\u201cthe Philadelphia Plan should be a useful and necessary tool for insuring equitable employment of minorities.\\u201d Id., at 41072.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nThe \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) set-aside is not a permanent part of federal contracting requirements. As soon as the PWEA program concludes, this set-aside program ends. The temporary nature of this remedy ensures that a race-conscious program will not last longer than the discriminatory effects it is designed to eliminate. It will be necessary for Congress to re-examine the need for a race-conscious remedy before it extends or re-enacts \\u00a7 103 (f)(2).\\n\\nThe percentage chosen for the set-aside is within the scope of congressional discretion. The Courts of Appeals have approved temporary hiring remedies insuring that the percentage of minority group workers in a business or governmental agency will be reasonably related to the percentage of minority group members in the relevant population. Boston Chapter NAACP v. Beecher, 504 F.2d, at 1027; Bridgeport Guardians, Inc. v. Bridgeport, 482 F.2d, at 1341; Carter v. Gallagher, 452 F.2d, at 331. Only 4% of contractors are members of minority groups, see Fullilove v. Kreps, 584 F.2d 600, 608 (CA2 1978), although minority group members constitute about 17% of the national population, see Constructors Association of Western Pennsylvania v. Kreps, 441 F.Supp. 936, 951 (WD Pa. 1977), aff\\u2019d, 573 F.2d 811 (CA3 1978). The choice of a 10% set-aside thus falls roughly halfway between the present percentage of minority contractors and the percentage of minority group members in the Nation.\\n\\nAlthough the set-aside is pegged at a reasonable figure, its effect might be unfair if it were applied rigidly in areas of the country where minority group members constitute a small percentage of the population. To meet this concern, Congress enacted a waiver provision into \\u00a7 103 (f)(2). The factors governing issuance of a waiver include the availability of qualified minority contractors in a particular geographic area, the size of the locale\\u2019s minority population, and the efforts made to find minority contractors. U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Local Public Works Program, Round II, Guidelines for 10% Minority Business Participation LPW Grants (1977); App. 165a-167a. We have been told that 1,261 waivers had been granted by September 9, 1979. Brief for Secretary of Commerce 62, n. 37.\\n\\nC\\n\\nA race-conscious remedy should not be approved without consideration of an additional crucial factor \\u2014 the effect of the set-aside upon innocent third parties. See Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S., at 374-375. In this case, the petitioners contend with some force that they have been asked to bear the burden of the set-aside even though they are innocent of wrongdoing. I do not believe, however, that their burden is so great that the set-aside must be disapproved. As noted above, Congress knew that minority contractors were receiving only 1% of federal contracts at the time the set-aside was enacted. The PWEA appropriated $ 4 billion for public work projects, of which it could be expected that approximately $ 400 million would go to minority contractors. The Court of Appeals calculated that the set-aside would reserve about 0.25% of all the funds expended yearly on construction work in the United States for approximately 4% of the Nation\\u2019s contractors who are members of a minority group. 584 F.2d, at 607-608. The set-aside would have no effect on the stability of the remaining 96% of contractors to compete for 99.75% of construction funds. In my view, the effect of the set-aside is limited and so widely dispersed that its use is consistent with fundamental fairness. n13\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn13 Although I believe that the burden placed upon nonminority contractors is not unconstitutional, I reject the suggestion that it is legally irrelevant. Apparently on the theory that Congress could have enacted no set-aside and provided $ 400 million less in funding, the Secretary of Commerce argues that \\u201c[nonminorities] have lost no right or legitimate expectation by the addition of Section 103 (f)(2) to the 1976 Act.\\u201d Brief for Secretary of Commerce 61. But the United States may not employ unconstitutional classifications, or base a decision upon unconstitutional considerations, when it provides a benefit to which a recipient is not legally entitled. Cf. Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 210-212 (1977) (opinion of BRENNAN, J.); Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S. 78, 81 (1971) (\\u201cTo characterize an Act of Congress as conferring a \\u2018public benefit\\u2019 does not, of course, immunize it from scrutiny under the Fifth Amendment\\u201d).\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nConsideration of these factors persuades me that the set-aside is a reasonably necessary means of furthering the compelling governmental interest in redressing the discrimination that affects minority contractors. Any marginal unfairness to innocent nonminority contractors is not sufficiently significant \\u2014 or sufficiently identifiable \\u2014 to outweigh the governmental interest served by \\u00a7 103 (f)(2). When Congress acts to remedy identified discrimination, it may exercise discretion in choosing a remedy that is reasonably necessary to accomplish its purpose. Whatever the exact breadth of that discretion, I believe that it encompasses the selection of the set-aside in this case. n14\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn14 Petitioners have suggested a variety of alternative programs that could be used in order to aid minority business enterprises in the construction industry. My view that this set-aside is within the discretion of Congress does not imply that other methods are unavailable to Congress. Nor do I conclude that use of a set-aside always will be an appropriate remedy or that the selection of a set-aside by any other governmental body would be constitutional. See Bakke, 438 U.S., at 309-310. The degree of specificity required in the findings of discrimination and the breadth of discretion in the choice of remedies may vary with the nature and authority of a governmental body.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nV\\n\\nIn the history of this Court and this country, few questions have been more divisive than those arising from governmental action taken on the basis of race. Indeed, our own decisions played no small part in the tragic legacy of government-sanctioned discrimination. See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896); Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857). At least since the decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the Court has been resolute in its dedication to the principle that the Constitution envisions a Nation where race is irrelevant. The time cannot come too soon when no governmental decision will be based upon immutable characteristics of pigmentation or origin. But in our quest to achieve a society free from racial classification, we cannot ignore the claims of those who still suffer from the effects of identifiable discrimination.\\n\\n[2C]Distinguishing the rights of all citizens to be free from racial classifications from the rights of some citizens to be made whole is a perplexing, but necessary, judicial task. When we first confronted such an issue in Bakke , I concluded that the Regents of the University of California were not competent to make, and had not made, findings sufficient to uphold the use of the race-conscious remedy they adopted. As my opinion made clear, I believe that the use of racial classifications, which are fundamentally at odds with the ideals of a democratic society implicit in the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, cannot be imposed simply to serve transient social or political goals, however worthy they may be. But the issue here turns on the scope of congressional power, and Congress has been given a unique constitutional role in the enforcement of the post-Civil War Amendments. In this case, where Congress determined that minority contractors were victims of purposeful discrimination and where Congress chose a reasonably necessary means to effectuate its purpose, I find no constitutional reason to invalidate \\u00a7 103 (f)(2). n15\\n\\n[2D]\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\nn15 Petitioners also contend that \\u00a7 103 (f)(2) violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,42 U.

Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 324-379 (1978). In my view, the 10% minority set-aside provision of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 passes constitutional muster under the standard announced in that opinion. n1\\n\\n[2F]\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\nn1 On the authority ofBakke, it is also clear to me that the set-aside provision does not violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 2000d et seq. In Bakke five Members of the Court were of the view that the prohibitions of Title VI \\u2014 which outlaws racial discrimination in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance \\u2014 are coextensive with the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. See 438 U.S., at 328 (opinion of BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, JJ.); id., at 287 (opinion of POWELL, J.).\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nI\\n\\n[3A]In Bakke, I joined my Brothers BRENNAN, WHITE, and BLACKMUN in articulating the view that \\u201cracial classifications are not per se invalid under [the Equal Protection Clause of] the Fourteenth Amendment.\\u201d Id., at 356 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter cited as joint separate opinion). n2 We acknowledged that \\u201ca government practice or statute which . . . contains \\u2018suspect classifications\\u2019 is to be subjected to \\u2018strict scrutiny\\u2019 and can be justified only if it furthers a compelling government purpose and, even then, only if no less restrictive alternative is available.\\u201d Id., at 357. Thus, we reiterated the traditional view that racial classifications are prohibited if they are irrelevant. Ibid. In addition, we firmly adhered to \\u201cthe cardinal principle that racial classifications that stigmatize \\u2014 because they are drawn on the presumption that one race is inferior to another or because they put the weight of government behind racial hatred and separatism \\u2014 are invalid without more.\\u201d Id., at 357-358.\\n\\n[3B]\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\nn2 InBakke, the issue was whether a special minority admissions program of a state medical school violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the present case, the issue is whether the minority set-aside provision violates the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. As noted in Bakke, \\u201c\\u2018[equal] protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment.'\\u201d Id., at 367, n. 43 (joint separate opinion) (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 93 (1976) (per curiam)).\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nWe recognized, however, that these principles outlawing the irrelevant or pernicious use of race were inapposite to racial classifications that provide benefits to minorities for the purpose of remedying the present effects of past racial discrimination. n3 Such classifications may disadvantage some whites, but whites as a class lack the \\u201c\\u2018traditional indicia of suspectness: the class is not saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.'\\u201d Id., at 357 (quoting San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973)). See also United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152, n. 4 (1938). Because the consideration of race is relevant to remedying the continuing effects of past racial discrimination, and because governmental programs employing racial classifications for remedial purposes can be crafted to avoid stigmatization, we concluded that such programs should not be subjected to conventional \\u201cstrict scrutiny\\u201d \\u2014 scrutiny that is strict in theory, but fatal in fact. Bakke, supra, at 362 (joint separate opinion).\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn3 In Bakke, the Medical School of the University of California at Davis had adopted a special admissions program in which 16 out of the 100 places in each entering class were reserved for disadvantaged minorities. A major purpose of this program was to ameliorate the present effects of past racial discrimination. See 438 U.S., at 362 (joint separate opinion); id., at 305-306 (opinion of POWELL, J.).\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nNor did we determine that such programs should be analyzed under the minimally rigorous rational-basis standard of review. 438 U.S., at 358. We recognized that race has often been used to stigmatize politically powerless segments of society, and that efforts to ameliorate the effects of past discrimination could be based on paternalistic stereotyping, not on a careful consideration of modern social conditions. In addition, we acknowledged that governmental classification on the immutable characteristic of race runs counter to the deep national belief that state-sanctioned benefits and burdens should bear some relationship to individual merit and responsibility. Id., at 360-361.\\n\\nWe concluded, therefore, that because a racial classification ostensibly designed for remedial purposes is susceptible to misuse, it may be justified only by showing \\u201can important and articulated purpose for its use.\\u201d Id., at 361. \\u201cIn addition, any statute must be stricken that stigmatizes any group or that singles out those least well represented in the political process to bear the brunt of a benign program.\\u201d Ibid. In our view, then, the proper inquiry is whether racial classifications designed to further remedial purposes serve important governmental objectives and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives. Id., at 359.\\n\\nII\\n\\nJudged under this standard, the 10% minority set-aside provision at issue in this case is plainly constitutional. Indeed, the question is not even a close one.\\n\\nAs MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER demonstrates, see ante, at 456-467, it is indisputable that Congress\\u2019 articulated purpose for enacting the set-aside provision was to remedy the present effects of past racial discrimination. See also the concurring opinion of my Brother POWELL, ante, at 503-506. Congress had a sound basis for concluding that minority-owned construction enterprises, though capable, qualified, and ready and willing to work, have received a disproportionately small amount of public contracting business because of the continuing effects of past discrimination. Here, as in Bakke, 438 U.S., at 362 (joint separate opinion), \\u201cminority underrepresentation is substantial and chronic, and . . . the handicap of past discrimination is impeding access of minorities to\\u201d the benefits of the governmental program. In these circumstances remedying these present effects of past racial discrimination is a sufficiently important governmental interest to justify the use of racial classification. Ibid. See generally id., at 362-373. n4\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn4 Petitioners argue that the set-aside is invalid because Congress did not create a sufficient legislative record to support its conclusion that racial classifications were required to ameliorate the present effects of past racial discrimination. In petitioners\\u2019 view, Congress must make particularized findings that past violations of the Equal Protection Clause and antidiscrimination statutes have a current effect on the construction industry.\\n\\nThis approach is fundamentally misguided. Unlike the courts, Congress is engaged in the broad mission of framing general social rules, not adjudicating individual disputes. Our prior decisions recognize Congress\\u2019 authority to \\u201crequire or authorize preferential treatment for those likely disadvantaged by societal racial discrimination. Such legislation has been sustained even without a requirement of findings of intentional racial discrimination by those required or authorized to accord preferential treatment, or a case-by-case determination that those to be benefited suffered from racial discrimination.\\u201d Bakke, 438 U.S., at 366 (joint separate opinion).\\n\\nSee also ante, at 478; the concurring opinion of my Brother POWELL, ante, at 502-503.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nBecause the means chosen by Congress to implement the set-aside provision are substantially related to the achievement of its remedial purpose, the provision also meets the second prong of our Bakke test. Congress reasonably determined that race-conscious means were necessary to break down the barriers confronting participation by minority enterprises in federally funded public works projects. That the set-aside creates a quota in favor of qualified and available minority business enterprises does not necessarily indicate that it stigmatizes. As our opinion stated in Bakke, \\u201c[for] purposes of constitutional adjudication, there is no difference between\\u201d setting aside \\u201ca predetermined number of places for qualified minority applicants rather than using minority status as a positive factor to be considered in evaluating the applications of disadvantaged minority applicants.\\u201d Id., at 378. The set-aside, as enacted by Congress and implemented by the Secretary of Commerce, is carefully tailored to remedy racial discrimination while at the same time avoiding stigmatization and penalizing those least able to protect themselves in the political process. See ante, at 480-489. Cf. the concurring opinion of my Brother POWELL, ante, at 508-515. Since under the set-aside provision a contract may be awarded to a minority enterprise only if it is qualified to do the work, the provision stigmatizes as inferior neither a minority firm that benefits from it nor a nonminority firm that is burdened by it. Nor does the set-aside \\u201cestablish a quota in the invidious sense of a ceiling,\\u201d Bakke, supra, at 375 (joint separate opinion), on the number of minority firms that can be awarded public works contracts. In addition, the set-aside affects only a miniscule amount of the funds annually expended in the United States for construction work. See ante, at 484-485, n. 72.\\n\\n[1E]In sum, it is clear to me that the racial classifications employed in the set-aside provision are substantially related to the achievement of the important and congressionally articulated goal of remedying the present effects of past racial discrimination. The provision, therefore, passes muster under the equal protection standard I adopted in Bakke.\\n\\nIII\\n\\nIn my separate opinion in Bakke, 438 U.S., at 387-396, I recounted the \\u201cingenious and pervasive forms of discrimination against the Negro\\u201d long condoned under the Constitution and concluded that \\u201c[the] position of the Negro today in America is the tragic but inevitable consequence of centuries of unequal treatment.\\u201d Id., at 387, 395. I there stated:\\n\\n\\u201cIt is because of a legacy of unequal treatment that we now must permit the institutions of this society to give consideration to race in making decisions about who will hold the positions of influence, affluence, and prestige in America. For far too long, the doors to those positions have been shut to Negroes. If we are ever to become a fully integrated society, one in which the color of a person\\u2019s skin will not determine the opportunities available to him or her, we must be willing to take steps to open those doors.\\u201d Id., at 401-402.\\n\\nThose doors cannot be fully opened without the acceptance of race-conscious remedies. As my Brother BLACKMUN observed in Bakke: \\u201cIn order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way.\\u201d Id., at 407 (separate opinion).\\n\\nCongress recognized these realities when it enacted the minority set-aside provision at issue in this case. Today, by upholding this race-conscious remedy, the Court accords Congress the authority necessary to undertake the task of moving our society toward a state of meaningful equality of opportunity, not an abstract version of equality in which the effects of past discrimination would be forever frozen into our social fabric. I applaud this result. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.\\n\\nDISSENT BY: STEWART; STEVENS\\n\\nDISSENT: MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST joins, dissenting.\\n\\n\\u201cOur Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. . . . The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color. . . .\\u201d Those words were written by a Member of this Court 84 years ago. Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559 (Harlan, J., dissenting). His colleagues disagreed with him, and held that a statute that required the separation of people on the basis of their race was constitutionally valid because it was a \\u201creasonable\\u201d exercise of legislative power and had been \\u201cenacted in good faith for the promotion [of] the public good. . . .\\u201d Id., at 550. Today, the Court upholds a statute that accords a preference to citizens who are \\u201cNegroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts,\\u201d for much the same reasons. I think today\\u2019s decision is wrong for the same reason that Plessy v. Ferguson was wrong, and I respectfully dissent.\\n\\nA\\n\\n[3C]The equal protection standard of the Constitution has one clear and central meaning \\u2014 it absolutely prohibits invidious discrimination by government. That standard must be met by every State under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 10; Hill v. Texas, 316 U.S. 400; Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 307-308; Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 71-72. And that standard must be met by the United States itself under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239; Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497. n1 Under our Constitution, any official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect and presumptively invalid. McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 192; Bolling v. Sharpe, supra, at 499; Korematsu v.

Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 93.\\n\\nn2 By contrast, nothing in the Constitution prohibits a private person from discriminating on the basis of race in his personal or business affairs. See Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193. The Fourteenth Amendment limits only the actions of the States; the Fifth Amendment limits only the actions of the National Government.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nThe hostility of the Constitution to racial classifications by government has been manifested in many cases decided by this Court. See, e. g., Loving v. Virginia, supra.; McLaughlin v. Florida, supra; Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483; Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U.S. 337. And our cases have made clear that the Constitution is wholly neutral in forbidding such racial discrimination, whatever the race may be of those who are its victims. In Anderson v. Martin, 375 U.S. 399, for instance, the Court dealt with a state law that required that the race of each candidate for election to public office be designated on the nomination papers and ballots. Although the law applied equally to candidates of whatever race, the Court held that it nonetheless violated the constitutional standard of equal protection. \\u201cWe see no relevance,\\u201d the Court said, \\u201cin the State\\u2019s pointing up the race of the candidate as bearing upon his qualifications for office.\\u201d Id., at 403 (emphasis added). Similarly, in Loving v. Virginia, supra, and McLaughlin v. Florida, supra, the Court held that statutes outlawing miscegenation and interracial cohabitation were constitutionally invalid, even though the laws penalized all violators equally. The laws were unconstitutional for the simple reason that they penalized individuals solely because of their race, whatever their race might be. See also Goss v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 683; Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60. n3\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn3 University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, and United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, do not suggest a different rule. The Court in Bakke invalidated the racially preferential admissions program that had deprived Bakke of equal access to a place in the medical school of a state university. In United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, a state legislature had apportioned certain voting districts with an awareness of their racial composition. Since the plaintiffs there had \\u201cfailed to show that the legislative reapportionment plan had either the purpose or the effect of discriminating against them on the basis of their race,\\u201d no constitutional violation had occurred. 430 U.S., at 179-180 (concurring opinion). No person in that case was deprived of his electoral franchise.\\n\\nMore than 35 years ago, during the Second World War, this Court did find constitutional a governmental program imposing injury on the basis of race. See Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214; Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81. Significantly, those cases were decided not only in time of war, but also in an era before the Court had held that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment imposes the same equal protection standard upon the Federal Government that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes upon the States. See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nThis history contains one clear lesson. Under our Constitution, the government may never act to the detriment of a person solely because of that person\\u2019s race. n4 The color of a person\\u2019s skin and the country of his origin are immutable facts that bear no relation to ability, disadvantage, moral culpability, or any other characteristics of constitutionally permissible interest to government. \\u201cDistinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\\u201d Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100, quoted in Loving v. Virginia, supra, at 11. n5 In short, racial discrimination is by definition individious discrimination.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn4 A court of equity may, of course, take race into account in devising a remedial decree to undo a violation of a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race. See Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324; Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747; Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 18-32. But such a judicial decree, following litigation in which a violation of law has been determined, is wholly different from generalized legislation that awards benefits and imposes detriments dependent upon the race of the recipients. See text in Part B, infra.\\n\\nn5 As Mr. Justice Murphy wrote in dissenting from the Court\\u2019s opinion and judgment in Korematsu v. United States, supra, at 242:\\n\\n\\u201cRacial discrimination in any form and in any degree has no justifiable part whatever in our democratic way of life.

The guarantee of equal protection is \\u201cuniversal in [its] application, to all persons . . . without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality.\\u201d Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369. See In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717; Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475; Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 39-43; Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S., at 308. The command of the equal protection guarantee is simple but unequivocal: In the words of the Fourteenth Amendment: \\u201cNo State shall . . . deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws.\\u201d Nothing in this language singles out some \\u201cpersons\\u201d for more \\u201cequal\\u201d treatment than others. Rather, as the Court made clear in Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 22, the benefits afforded by the Equal Protection Clause \\u201care, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual. [They] are personal rights.\\u201d From the perspective of a person detrimentally affected by a racially discriminatory law, the arbitrariness and unfairness is entirely the same, whatever his skin color and whatever the law\\u2019s purpose, be it purportedly \\u201cfor the promotion of the public good\\u201d or otherwise.\\n\\nNo one disputes the self-evident proposition that Congress has broad discretion under its spending power to disburse the revenues of the United States as it deems best and to set conditions on the receipt of the funds disbursed. No one disputes that Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate contracting practices on federally funded public works projects, or that it enjoys broad powers under \\u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment \\u201cto enforce by appropriate legislation\\u201d the provisions of that Amendment. But these self-evident truisms do not begin to answer the question before us in this case. For in the exercise of its powers, Congress must obey the Constitution just as the legislatures of all the States must obey the Constitution in the exercise of their powers. If a law is unconstitutional, it is no less unconstitutional just because it is a product of the Congress of the United States.\\n\\nB\\n\\nOn its face, the minority business enterprise (MBE) provision at issue in this case denies the equal protection of the law. The Public Works Employment Act of 1977 directs that all project construction shall be performed by those private contractors who submit the lowest competitive bids and who meet established criteria of responsibility. 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 6705 (e)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. II). One class of contracting firms \\u2014 defined solely according to the racial and ethnic attributes of their owners \\u2014 is, however, excepted from the full rigor of these requirements with respect to a percentage of each federal grant. The statute, on its face and in effect, thus bars a class to which the petitioners belong from having the opportunity to receive a government benefit, and bars the members of that class solely on the basis of their race or ethnic background. This is precisely the kind of law that the guarantee of equal protection forbids.\\n\\nThe Court\\u2019s attempt to characterize the law as a proper remedial measure to counteract the effects of past or present racial discrimination is remarkably unconvincing. The Legislative Branch of government is not a court of equity.

The MBE provision thus pushes the limits of any such justification far beyond the equal protection standard of the Constitution. Certainly, nothing in the Constitution gives Congress any greater authority to impose detriments on the basis of race than is afforded the Judicial Branch. n7 And a judicial decree that imposes burdens on the basis of race can be upheld only where its sole purpose is to eradicate the actual effects of illegal race discrimination.

Its legislative history suggests that it had at least two other objectives in addition to that of counteracting the effects of past or present racial discrimination in the public works construction industry. n8 One such purpose appears to have been to assure to minority contractors a certain percentage of federally funded public works contracts. n9 But, since the guarantee of equal protection immunizes from capricious governmental treatment \\u201cpersons\\u201d \\u2014 not \\u201craces\\u201d \\u2014 it can never countenance laws that seek racial balance as a goal in and of itself. \\u201cPreferring members of any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake. This the Constitution forbids.\\u201d University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 307 (opinion of POWELL, J.). Second, there are indications that the MBE provision may have been enacted to compensate for the effects of social, educational, and economic \\u201cdisadvantage.\\u201d n10 No race, however, has a monopoly on social, educational, or economic disadvantage, n11 and any law that indulges in such a presumption clearly violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. Since the MBE provision was in whole or in part designed to effectuate objectives other than the elimination of the effects of racial discrimination, it cannot stand as a remedy that comports with the strictures of equal protection, even if it otherwise could. n12\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn8 The legislative history of the MBE provision itself contains not one mention of racial discrimination or the need to provide a mechanism to correct the effects of such discrimination. From the context of the Act, however, it is reasonable to infer that the program was enacted, at least in part, to remedy perceived past and present racial discrimination. In 1977, Congress knew that many minority business enterprises had historically suffered racial discrimination in the economy as a whole and in the construction industry in particular. See H. R. Rep. No. 94-1791, pp. 182-183 (1977); H. R. Rep. No. 94-468, pp. 1-2 (1975); To Amend and Extend the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act: Hearings on H. R. 11 and Related Bills before the Subcommittee on Economic Development of the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 939 (1977) (statement of Rep. Conyers). Some of this discrimination may well, in fact, have violated one or more of the state and federal antidiscrimination laws.\\n\\nn9 See 123 Cong. Rec. 5327 (1977) (Rep. Mitchell) (\\u201call [the MBE provision] attempts to do is to provide that those who are in minority businesses get a fair share of the action from this public works legislation\\u201d) (emphasis supplied). Moreover, sponsors of the legislation repeatedly referred to the low participation rate of minority businesses in federal procurement programs. See id., at 5331 (Rep. Biaggi); id., at 5327-5328 (Rep. Mitchell); id., at 5097-5098 (Rep. Mitchell); id., at 7156 (Sen. Brooke).\\n\\nn10 See id., at 5330 (Rep. Conyers) (\\u201cminority contractors and businessmen who are trying to enter in on the bidding process . . . get the \\u2018works\\u2019 almost every time. The bidding process is one whose intricacies defy the imaginations of most of us here\\u201d). That the elimination of \\u201cdisadvantage\\u201d is one of the program\\u2019s objectives is an inference that finds support in the agency\\u2019s own interpretation of the statute. See U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Economic Development Administration, EDA Minority Business Enterprise Technical Bulletin (Additional Assistance and Information Available to Grantees and Their Contractors In Meeting The 10% MBE Requirement) 9-10 (1977) (Technical Bulletin) (\\u201ca [minority] subcontractor\\u2019s price should not be considered unreasonable if he is merely trying to cover his costs because the price results from disadvantage which affects the MBE\\u2019s costs of doing business or results from discrimination\\u201d (emphasis added)).\\n\\nn11 For instance, in 1978, 83.4% of persons over the age of 25 who had not completed high school were \\u201cwhite,\\u201d see U.S. Dept. of Commerce Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 145 (1979), and in 1977, 79.0% of households with annual incomes of less than $ 5,000 were \\u201cwhite,\\u201d see id., at 458.\\n\\nn12 Moreover, even a properly based judicial decree will be struck down if the scope of the remedy it provides is not carefully tailored to fit the nature and extent of the violation. See Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 419-420; Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717. Here, assuming that the MBE provision was intended solely as a remedy for past and present racial discrimination, it sweeps far too broadly. It directs every state and local government covered by the program to set aside 10% of its grant for minority business enterprises. Waivers from that requirement are permitted, but only where insufficient numbers of minority businesses capable of doing the work at nonexorbitant prices are located in the relevant contracting area. No waiver is provided for any governmental entity that can prove a history free of racial discrimination. Nor is any exemption permitted for nonminority contractors that are able to demonstrate that they have not engaged in racially discriminatory behavior. Finally, the statute makes no attempt to direct the aid it provides solely toward those minority contracting firms that arguably still suffer from the effects of past or present discrimination.\\n\\nThese are not the characteristics of a racially conscious remedial decree that is closely tailored to the evil to be corrected. In today\\u2019s society, it constitutes far too gross an oversimplification to assume that every single Negro, Spanish-speaking citizen, Oriental, Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut potentially interested in construction contracting currently suffers from the effects of past or present racial discrimination. Since the MBE set-aside must be viewed as resting upon such an assumption, it necessarily paints with too broad a brush. Except to make whole the identified victims of racial discrimination, the guarantee of equal protection prohibits the government from taking detrimental action against innocent people on the basis of the sins of others of their own race.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nC\\n\\nThe Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to ensure that every person must be treated equally by each State regardless of the color of his skin.

I, \\u00a7 9, cl. 8 (\\u201cNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States\\u201d).

Laws that operate on the basis of race require definitions of race. Because of the Court\\u2019s decision today, our statute books will once again have to contain laws that reflect the odious practice of delineating the qualities that make one person a Negro and make another white. n14 Moreover, racial discrimination, even \\u201cgood faith\\u201d racial discrimination, is inevitably a two-edged sword. \\u201c[Preferential] programs may only reinforce common stereotypes holding that certain groups are unable to achieve success without special protection based on a factor having no relationship to individual worth.\\u201d University of California Regents v. Bakke, supra, at 298 (opinion of POWELL, J.). Most importantly, by making race a relevant criterion once again in its own affairs the Government implicitly teaches the public that the apportionment of rewards and penalties can legitimately be made according to race \\u2014 rather than according to merit or ability \\u2014 and that people can, and perhaps should, view themselves and others in terms of their racial characteristics. Notions of \\u201cracial entitlement\\u201d will be fostered, and private discrimination will necessarily be encouraged. n15 See Hughes v. Superior Court, 339 U.S. 460, 463-464; T. Eastland & W.

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.\\n\\nThe 10% set-aside contained in the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 (Act), 91 Stat. 116, creates monopoly privileges in a $ 400 million market for a class of investors defined solely by racial characteristics. The direct beneficiaries of these monopoly privileges are the relatively small number of persons within the racial classification who represent the entrepreneurial subclass \\u2014 those who have, or can borrow, working capital.\\n\\nHistory teaches us that the costs associated with a sovereign\\u2019s grant of exclusive privileges often encompass more than the high prices and shoddy workmanship that are familiar handmaidens of monopoly; they engender animosity and discontent as well. The economic consequences of using noble birth as a basis for classification in 18th-century France, though disastrous, were nothing as compared with the terror that was engendered in the name of \\u201cegalite\\u201d and \\u201cfraternite.\\u201d Grants of privilege on the basis of characteristics acquired at birth are far from an unmixed blessing.\\n\\nOur historic aversion to titles of nobility n1 is only one aspect of our commitment to the proposition that the sovereign has a fundamental duty to govern impartially. n2 When government accords different treatment to different persons, there must be a reason for the difference. n3 Because racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment, n4 and because classifications based on race are potentially so harmful to the entire body politic, n5 it is especially important that the reasons for any such classification be clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn1 \\u201cSuch pure discrimination is most certainly not a \\u2018legitimate purpose\\u2019 for our Federal Government, which should be especially sensitive to discrimination on grounds of birth. \\u2018Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\\u2019 Hirabayashi v.

The Declaration of Independence states:\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cAnd the rationale behind the prohibition against the grant of any title of nobility by the United States, see U.S. Const., Art.

Lucas, supra, at 520-521 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted).\\n\\nn5 Indeed, the very attempt to define with precision a beneficiary\\u2019s qualifying racial characteristics is repugnant to our constitutional ideals. The so-called guidelines developed by the Economic Development Administration, see the appendix to the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, para. 3, ante, at 494-495, are so general as to be fairly innocuous; as a consequence they are too vague to be useful. For example, it is unclear whether the firm described in n. 16, infra, would be eligible for the 10% set-aside. If the National Government is to make a serious effort to define racial classes by criteria that can be administered objectively, it must study precedents such as the First Regulation to the Reichs Citizenship Law of November 14, 1935, translated in 4 Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, Document No. 1417-PS, pp. 8-9 (1946):\\n\\n\\u201cOn the basis of Article 3, Reichs Citizenship Law, of 15 Sept. 1935 (RGB1. I, page 146) the following is ordered:\\n\\n. . . .\\n\\n\\u201cArticle 5\\n\\n\\u201c1. A Jew is anyone who descended from at least three grandparents who were racially full Jews. Article 2, par. 2, second sentence will apply.\\n\\n\\u201c2. A Jew is also one who descended from two full Jewish parents, if: (a) he belonged to the Jewish religious community at the time this law was issued, or who joined the community later; (b) he was married to a Jewish person, at the time the law was issued, or married one subsequently; (c) he is the offspring from a marriage with a Jew, in the sense of Section 1, which was contracted after the Law for the protection of German blood and German honor became effective (RGB1. I, page 1146 of 15 Sept. 1935); (d) he is the offspring of an extramarital relationship, with a Jew, according to Section 1, and will be born out of wedlock after July 31, 1936.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nThe statutory definition of the preferred class includes \\u201ccitizens of the United States who are Negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts.\\u201d All aliens and all nonmembers of the racial class are excluded. No economic, social, geographical, or historical criteria are relevant for exclusion or inclusion. There is not one word in the remainder of the Act or in the legislative history that explains why any Congressman or Senator favored this particular definition over any other or that identifies the common characteristics that every member of the preferred class was believed to share. n6 Nor does the Act or its history explain why 10% of the total appropriation was the proper amount to set aside for investors in each of the six racial subclasses. n7\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn6 In 1968, almost 10 years before the Act was passed, the Small Business Administration had developed a program to assist small business concerns owned or controlled by \\u201csocially or economically disadvantaged persons.\\u201d The agency\\u2019s description of persons eligible for such assistance stated that such \\u201cpersons include, but are not limited to, black Americans, American Indians, Spanish-Americans, oriental Americans, Eskimos and Aleuts. . . .\\u201d See opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, ante, at 463-464. This may be the source of the definition of the class at issue in this case. See also ante, at 487-488, n. 73. But the SBA\\u2019s class of socially or economically disadvantaged persons neither included all persons in the racial class nor excluded all nonmembers of the racial class. Race was used as no more than a factor in identifying the class of the disadvantaged. The difference between the statutory quota involved in this case and the SBA\\u2019s 1968 description of those whose businesses were to be assisted under \\u00a7 8 (a) of the Small Business Act is thus at least as great as the difference between the University of California\\u2019s racial quota and the Harvard admissions system that MR. JUSTICE POWELL regarded as critical in University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 315-318.\\n\\nn7 It was noted that the value of the federal contracts awarded to minority business firms in prior years had amounted to less than 1% of the total; since the statutory set-aside of 10% may be satisfied by subcontracts to minority business enterprises, it is possible that compliance with the statute would not change the 1% figure.\\n\\nThe legislative history also revealed that minority business enterprises represented about 3 or 4% of all eligible firms; the history does not indicate, however, whether the 10% figure was intended to provide the existing firms with three times as much business as they could expect to receive on a random basis or to encourage members of the class to acquire or form new firms. An Economic Development Administration guideline arguably implies that new investments made in order to take advantage of the 10% set-aside would not be considered \\u201cbona fide.\\u201d See appendix to the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, ante, at 492.\\n\\nThe 10% figure bears no special relationship to the relative size of the entire racial class, to any of the six subclasses, or to the population of the subclasses in the areas where they primarily reside. The Aleuts and the Eskimos, for example, respectively represent less than 1% and 7% of the population of Alaska, see The New Columbia Encyclopedia 47, 59, 891 (4th ed. 1975), while Spanish-speaking or Negro citizens represent a majority or almost a majority in a large number of urban areas.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nFour different, though somewhat interrelated, justifications for the racial classification in this Act have been advanced: first, that the 10% set-aside is a form of reparation for past injuries to the entire membership of the class; second, that it is an appropriate remedy for past discrimination against minority business enterprises that have been denied access to public contracts; third, that the members of the favored class have a special entitlement to \\u201ca piece of the action\\u201d when government is distributing benefits; and, fourth, that the program is an appropriate method of fostering greater minority participation in a competitive economy. Each of these asserted justifications merits separate scrutiny.\\n\\nI\\n\\nRacial characteristics may serve to define a group of persons who have suffered a special wrong and who, therefore, are entitled to special reparations. Congress has recognized, for example, that the United States has treated some Indian tribes unjustly and has created procedures for allowing members of the injured classes to obtain classwide relief. See, e. g., Delaware Tribal Business Committee v. Weeks, 430 U.S. 73. But as I have formerly suggested, if Congress is to authorize a recovery for a class of similarly situated victims of a past wrong, it has an obligation to distribute that recovery among the members of the injured class in an even-handed way. See id., at 97-98 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Moreover, in such a case the amount of the award should bear some rational relationship to the extent of the harm it is intended to cure.\\n\\nIn his eloquent separate opinion in University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 387, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL recounted the tragic class-based discrimination against Negroes that is an indelible part of America\\u2019s history. I assume that the wrong committed against the Negro class is both so serious and so pervasive that it would constitutionally justify an appropriate classwide recovery measured by a sum certain for every member of the injured class. Whether our resources are adequate to support a fair remedy of that character is a policy question I have neither the authority nor the wisdom to address. But that serious classwide wrong cannot in itself justify the particular classification Congress has made in this Act. Racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification. Quite obviously, the history of discrimination against black citizens in America cannot justify a grant of privileges to Eskimos or Indians.\\n\\nEven if we assume that each of the six racial subclasses has suffered its own special injury at some time in our history, surely it does not necessarily follow that each of those subclasses suffered harm of identical magnitude. Although \\u201cthe Negro was dragged to this country in chains to be sold in slavery,\\u201d Bakke, supra, at 387 (opinion of MARSHALL, J.), the \\u201cSpanish-speaking\\u201d subclass came voluntarily, frequently without invitation, and the Indians, the Eskimos and the Aleuts had an opportunity to exploit America\\u2019s resources before the ancestors of most American citizens arrived. There is no reason to assume, and nothing in the legislative history suggests, much less demonstrates, that each of the subclasses is equally entitled to reparations from the United States Government. n8\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn8 Ironically, the Aleuts appear to have been ruthlessly exploited at some point in their history by Russian fur traders.

For those who are the most disadvantaged within each class are the least likely to receive any benefit from the special privilege even though they are the persons most likely still to be suffering the consequences of the past wrong. n9 A random distribution to a favored few is a poor form of compensation for an injury shared by many.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn9 For a similar reason, the discrimination against males condemned in Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, could not be justified as a remedy for past discrimination against females. That case involved a statutory provision which relieved widows from the obligation of proving dependency on their deceased spouses in order to obtain benefits, but did not similarly relieve widowers.\\n\\n\\u201cThe widows who benefit from the disparate treatment are those who were sufficiently successful in the job market to become nondependent on their husbands. Such a widow is the least likely to need special benefits. The widow most in need is the one who is \\u2018suddenly forced into a job market with which she is unfamiliar, and in which, because of her former economic dependency, she will have fewer skills to offer.\\u2019 [Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351,] 354. To accept the Kahn justification we must presume that Congress deliberately gave a special benefit to those females least likely to have been victims of the historic discrimination discussed in Kahn.\\u201d Id., at 221 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nMy principal objection to the reparation justification for this legislation, however, cuts more deeply than my concern about its inequitable character. We can never either erase or ignore the history that MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL has recounted. But if that history can justify such a random distribution of benefits on racial lines as that embodied in this statutory scheme, it will serve not merely as a basis for remedial legislation, but rather as a permanent source of justification for grants of special privileges. For if there is no duty to attempt either to measure the recovery by the wrong or to distribute that recovery within the injured class in an evenhanded way, our history will adequately support a legislative preference for almost any ethnic, religious, or racial group with the political strength to negotiate \\u201ca piece of the action\\u201d for its members.\\n\\nAlthough I do not dispute the validity of the assumption that each of the subclasses identified in the Act has suffered a severe wrong at some time in the past, I cannot accept this slapdash statute as a legitimate method of providing classwide relief.\\n\\nII\\n\\nThe Act may also be viewed as a much narrower remedial measure \\u2014 one designed to grant relief to the specific minority business enterprises that have been denied access to public contracts by discriminatory practices.\\n\\nThe legislative history of the Act does not tell us when, or how often, any minority business enterprise was denied such access. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to infer that the number of such incidents has been relatively small in recent years. For, as noted by the Solicitor General, in the last 20 years Congress has enacted numerous statutes designed to eliminate discrimination and its effects from federally funded programs. n10 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 unequivocally and comprehensively prohibits discrimination on the basis of race in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. In view of the scarcity of litigated claims on behalf of minority business enterprises during this period, and the lack of any contrary evidence in the legislative record, it is appropriate to presume that the law has generally been obeyed.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn10 \\u201cThe statute with the most comprehensive coverage is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.

Since the passage of Title VI, many other specific federal grant statutes have contained similar prohibitions against discrimination in particular funded activities. See, e. g., State and Local Fiscal Assistance Amendments of 1976, 31 U. S. C. 1242; Energy Conservation and Production Act, 42 U. S. C. 6870; Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U. S.

For the statute grants the special preference to a class that includes (1) those minority-owned firms that have successfully obtained business in the past on a free competitive basis and undoubtedly are capable of doing so in the future as well; (2) firms that have never attempted to obtain any public business in the past; (3) firms that were initially formed after the Act was passed, including those that may have been organized simply to take advantage of its provisions; n11 (4) firms that have tried to obtain public business but were unsuccessful for reasons that are unrelated to the racial characteristics of their stockholders; and (5) those firms that have been victimized by racial discrimination.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn11 Although the plain language of the statute appears to include such firms, as I have already noted, n. 7, supra, the EDA guidelines may consider such newly formed firms ineligible for the statutory set-aside.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nSince there is no reason to believe that any of the firms in the first four categories had been wrongfully excluded from the market for public contracts, the statutory preference for those firms cannot be justified as a remedial measure. And since a judicial remedy was already available for the firms in the fifth category, n12 it seems inappropriate to regard the preference as a remedy designed to redress any specific wrongs. n13 In any event, since it is highly unlikely that the composition of the fifth category is at all representative of the entire class of firms to which the statute grants a valuable preference, it is ill-fitting to characterize this as a \\u201cnarrowly tailored\\u201d remedial measure. n14\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn12 See University of California Regents v.

C. \\u00a7 6727 (d).\\n\\nn13 I recognize that the EDA has issued a Technical Bulletin, relied on heavily by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, ante, at 469-472, which distinguishes between higher bids quoted by minority subcontractors which are attributable to the effects of disadvantage or discrimination and those which are not. That is, according to the Bulletin, if it is determined that a subcontractor\\u2019s uncompetitive high price is not attributable to the effects of discrimination, a contractor may be entitled to relief from the 10% set-aside requirement. But even assuming that the Technical Bulletin accurately reflects Congress\\u2019 intent in enacting the set-aside, it is not easy to envision how one could realistically demonstrate with any degree of precision, if at all, the extent to which a bid has been inflated by the effects of disadvantage or past discrimination. Consequently, while THE CHIEF JUSTICE describes the set-aside as a remedial measure, it plainly operates as a flat quota.\\n\\nn14 See THE CHIEF JUSTICE\\u2019s opinion, ante, at 480.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nIII\\n\\nThe legislative history of the Act discloses that there is a group of legislators in Congress identified as the \\u201cBlack Caucus\\u201d and that members of that group argued that if the Federal Government was going to provide $ 4 billion of new public contract business, their constituents were entitled to \\u201ca piece of the action.\\u201d\\n\\nIt is neither unusual nor reprehensible for Congressmen to promote the authorization of public construction in their districts. The flow of capital and employment into a district inevitably has both direct and indirect consequences that are beneficial. As MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN noted in Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, however, the award of such contracts may become a form of political patronage that is dispensed by the party in power. n15 Although the practice of awarding such contracts to political allies may be as much a part of our history as the employment practices condemned in Elrod, it would surely be unconstitutional for the legislature to specify that all, or a certain portion, of the contracts authorized by a specific statute must be given to businesses controlled by members of one political party or another. That would be true even if the legislative majority was convinced that a grossly disproportionate share had been awarded to members of the opposite party in previous years.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn15 \\u201cNonofficeholders may be the beneficiaries of lucrative government contracts for highway construction, buildings, and supplies.\\u201d 427 U.S., at 353.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nIn the short run our political processes might benefit from legislation that enhanced the ability of representatives of minority groups to disseminate patronage to their political backers. But in the long run any rule that authorized the award of public business on a racial basis would be just as objectionable as one that awarded such business on a purely partisan basis.\\n\\nThe legislators\\u2019 interest in providing their constituents with favored access to benefits distributed by the Federal Government is, in my opinion, a plainly impermissible justification for this racial classification.\\n\\nIV\\n\\nThe interest in facilitating and encouraging the participation by minority business enterprises in the economy is unquestionably legitimate. Any barrier to such entry and growth \\u2014 whether grounded in the law or in irrational prejudice \\u2014 should be vigorously and thoroughly removed. Equality of economic and investment opportunity is a goal of no less importance than equality of employment opportunity. This statute, however, is not designed to remove any barriers to entry. Nor does its sparse legislative history detail any insuperable or even significant obstacles to entry into the competitive market.\\n\\nThree difficulties encountered by minority business enterprises in seeking governmental business on a competitive basis are identified in the legislative history. There were references to (1) unfamiliarity with bidding procedures followed by procurement officers, (2) difficulties in obtaining financing, and (3) past discrimination in the construction industry.\\n\\nThe first concern is no doubt a real problem for all businesses seeking access to the public contract market for the first time. It justifies a thorough review of bidding practices to make sure that they are intelligible and accessible to all. It by no means justifies an assumption that minority business enterprises are any less able to prepare and submit bids in proper form than are any other businessmen. Consequently, that concern does not justify a statutory classification on racial grounds.\\n\\nThe second concern would justify legislating prohibiting private discrimination in lending practices or authorizing special public financing for firms that have been or are unable to borrow money for reasons unrelated to their credit rating. It would not be an adequate justification for a requirement that a fixed percentage of all loans made by national banks be made to Eskimos or Orientals regardless of their ability to repay the loans. Nor, it seems to me, does it provide a sufficient justification for granting a preference to a broad class that includes, at one extreme, firms that have no credit problem n16 and at the other extreme, firms whose unsatisfactory credit rating will prevent them from taking advantage of the statutory preference even though they are otherwise qualified to do the work. At best, the preference for minority business enterprises is a crude and inadequate response to the evils that flow from discriminatory lending practices.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn16 An example of such a firm was disclosed in the record of a recent case involving a claimed preference for a firm controlled by Indian shareholders:\\n\\n\\u201cBased on the facts that were developed in the District Court, . . . the Indian community in general does not benefit from the [Bureau of Indian Affairs\\u2019] interpretation of [the Buy Indian Act].\\n\\n\\u201cThe facts that were developed in the District Court show that the beneficiaries of this interpretation were the owners of Indian Nations Construction Company. The president of that company is a one-fourth degree Indian who is an administrative law judge for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare by occupation. The vice president of that company was a one-quarter blood Choctaw who is a self-employed rancher and who states his net worth at just under a half million dollars. The treasurer and general manager of that corporation is a non-Indian and he states his net worth at $ 1.3 million.\\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. in Andrus v.

In analyzing this question, I think it is essential to draw a distinction between obstacles placed in the path of minority business enterprises by others and characteristics of those firms that may impair their ability to compete.\\n\\nIt is unfortunately but unquestionably true that irrational racial prejudice persists today and continues to obstruct minority participation in a variety of economic pursuits, presumably including the construction industry. But there are two reasons why this legislation will not eliminate, or even tend to eliminate, such prejudice. First, prejudice is less likely to be a significant factor in the public sector of the economy than in the private sector because both federal and state laws have prohibited discrimination in the award of public contracts for many years. Second, and of greater importance, an absolute preference that is unrelated to a minority firm\\u2019s ability to perform a contract inevitably will engender resentment on the part of competitors excluded from the market for a purely racial reason and skepticism on the part of customers and suppliers aware of the statutory classification. It thus seems clear to me that this Act cannot be defended as an appropriate method of reducing racial prejudice.\\n\\nThe argument that our history of discrimination has left the entire membership of each of the six racial classes identified in the Act less able to compete in a free market than others is more easily stated than proved. The reduction in prejudice that has occurred during the last generation has accomplished much less than was anticipated; it nevertheless remains true that increased opportunities have produced an ever-increasing number of demonstrations that members of disadvantaged races are entirely capable not merely of competing on an equal basis, but also of excelling in the most demanding professions. But, even though it is not the actual predicate for this legislation, a statute of this kind inevitably is perceived by many as resting on an assumption that those who are granted this special preference are less qualified in some respect that is identified purely by their race. n17 Because that perception \\u2014 especially when fostered by the Congress of the United States \\u2014 can only exacerbate rather than reduce racial prejudice, it will delay the time when race will become a truly irrelevant, or at least insignificant, factor. Unless Congress clearly articulates the need and basis for a racial classification, and also tailors the classification to its justification, the Court should not uphold this kind of statute.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn17 See United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 173-174 (BRENNAN, J., concurring in part): \\u201c[Even] preferential treatment may act to stigmatize its recipient groups, for although intended to correct systemic or institutional inequities, such a policy may imply to some the recipients\\u2019 inferiority and especial need for protection.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nThis Act has a character that is fundamentally different from a carefully drafted remedial measure like the Voting Rights Act of 1965. A consideration of some of the dramatic differences between these two legislative responses to racial injustice reveals not merely a difference in legislative craftsmanship but a difference of constitutional significance. Whereas the enactment of the Voting Rights Act was preceded by exhaustive hearings and debates concerning discriminatory denial of access to the electoral process, and became effective in specific States only after specific findings were made, this statute authorizes an automatic nationwide preference for all members of a diverse racial class regardless of their possible interest in the particular geographic areas where the public contracts are to be performed. Just why a wealthy Negro or Spanish-speaking investor should have a preferred status in bidding on a construction contract in Alaska \\u2014 or a citizen of Eskimo ancestry should have a preference in Miami or Detroit \\u2014 is difficult to understand in light of either the asserted remedial character of the set-aside or the more basic purposes of the public works legislation.\\n\\nThe Voting Rights Act addressed the problem of denial of access to the electoral process. By outlawing specific practices, such as poll taxes and special tests, the statute removed old barriers to equal access; by requiring preclearance of changes in voting practices in covered States, it precluded the erection of new barriers. The Act before us today does not outlaw any existing barriers to access to the economic market and does nothing to prevent the erection of new barriers. On the contrary, it adopts the fundamentally different approach of creating a new set of barriers of its own.\\n\\nA comparable approach in the electoral context would support a rule requiring that at least 10% of the candidates elected to the legislature be members of specified racial minorities. Surely that would be an effective way of ensuring black citizens the representation that has long been their due. Quite obviously, however, such a measure would merely create the kind of inequality that an impartial sovereign cannot tolerate. Yet that is precisely the kind of \\u201cremedy\\u201d that this Act authorizes. In both political and economic contexts, we have a legitimate interest in seeing that those who were disadvantaged in the past may succeed in the future. But neither an election nor a market can be equally accessible to all if race provides a basis for placing a special value on votes or dollars.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal must be to eliminate entirely from governmental decisionmaking such irrelevant factors as a human being\\u2019s race. The removal of barriers to access to political and economic processes serves that goal. n18 But the creation of new barriers can only frustrate true progress. For as MR. JUSTICE POWELL n19 and Mr. Justice Douglas n20 have perceptively observed, such protective barriers reinforce habitual ways of thinking in terms of classes instead of individuals. Preferences based on characteristics acquired at birth foster intolerance and antagonism against the entire membership of the favored classes. n21 For this reason, I am firmly convinced that this \\u201ctemporary measure\\u201d will disserve the goal of equal opportunity.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn18 \\u201cThe Equal Protection Clause commands the elimination of racial barriers, not their creation in order to satisfy our theory as to how society ought to be organized.\\u201d DeFunis v.

See Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 101-102, n. 21. n22 But the exercise of these broad powers is subject to the constraints imposed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

I am nonetheless persuaded that it does impose a special obligation to scrutinize any governmental decisionmaking process that draws nationwide distinctions between citizens on the basis of their race and incidentally also discriminates against noncitizens in the preferred racial classes. n23 For just as procedural safeguards are necessary to guarantee impartial decisionmaking in the judicial process, so can they play a vital part in preserving the impartial character of the legislative process. n24\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn23 \\u201cWhen the Federal Government asserts an overriding national interest as justification for a discriminatory rule which would violate the Equal Protection Clause if adopted by a State, due process requires that there be a legitimate basis for presuming that the rule was actually intended to serve that interest.\\u201d Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 103.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is perfectly clear that neither the Congress nor the President has ever required the Civil Service Commission to adopt the citizenship requirement as a condition of eligibility for employment in the federal civil service. On the other hand, in view of the fact that the policy has been in effect since the Commission was created in 1883, it is fair to infer that both the Legislature and the Executive have been aware of the policy and have acquiesced in it. In order to decide whether such acquiescence should give the Commission rule the same support as an express statutory or Presidential command, it is appropriate to review the extent to which the policy has been given consideration by Congress or the President, and the nature of the authority specifically delegated to the Commission.\\u201d Id., at 105.\\n\\nn24 See Linde, Due Process of Lawmaking, 55 Neb. L. Rev. 197, 255 (1976):\\n\\n\\u201cFor the last few years have reawakened our appreciation of the primacy of process over product in a free society, the knowledge that no ends can be better than the means of their achievement. \\u2018The highest morality is almost always the morality of process,\\u2019 Professor Bickel wrote about Watergate a few months before his untimely death. If this republic is remembered in the distant history of law, it is likely to be for its enduring adherence to legitimate institutions and processes, not for its perfection of unique principles of justice and certainly not for the rationality of its laws. This recognition now may well take our attention beyond the processes of adjudication and of executive government to a new concern with the due process of lawmaking.\\u201d (Footnote omitted.)\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nIn both its substantive and procedural aspects this Act is markedly different from the normal product of the legislative decisionmaking process. The very fact that Congress for the first time in the Nation\\u2019s history has created a broad legislative classification for entitlement to benefits based solely on racial characteristics identifies a dramatic difference between this Act and the thousands of statutes that preceded it. This dramatic point of departure is not even mentioned in the statement of purpose of the Act or in the Reports of either the House or the Senate Committee that processed the legislation, n25 and was not the subject of any testimony or inquiry in any legislative hearing on the bill that was enacted. It is true that there was a brief discussion on the floor of the House as well as in the Senate on two different days, but only a handful of legislators spoke and there was virtually no debate. This kind of perfunctory consideration of an unprecedented policy decision of profound constitutional importance to the Nation is comparable to the accidental malfunction of the legislative process that led to what I regarded as a totally unjustified discrimination in Delaware Tribal Business Committee v. Weeks, 430 U.S., at 97.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn25 The only reference to any minority business enterprises in the Senate Report was a suggestion that Indians had been receiving too great a share of the public contracts. The Report stated:\\n\\n\\u201cSome concern was expressed that Indians \\u2014 with exceptionally high structural unemployment levels \\u2014 were awarded projects at a per capita value far in excess of non-Indian communities.\\u201d S. Rep. No. 95-38, p. 3 (1977).\\n\\nThe Court quotes three paragraphs from a lengthy Report issued by the House Committee on Small Business in 1977, ante, at 465-466, implying that the contents of that Report were considered by Congress when it enacted the 10% minority set-aside. But that Report was not mentioned by anyone during the very brief discussion of the set-aside amendment. When one considers the vast quantity of written material turned out by the dozens of congressional committees and subcommittees these days, it is unrealistic to assume that a significant number of legislators read, or even were aware of, that Report. Even if they did, the Report does not contain an explanation of this 10% set-aside for six racial subclasses.\\n\\nIndeed, the broad racial classification in this Act is totally unexplained. Although the legislative history discussed by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and by MR. JUSTICE POWELL explains why Negro citizens are included within the preferred class, there is absolutely no discussion of why Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts were also included. See n. 6, supra.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nAlthough it is traditional for judges to accord the same presumption of regularity to the legislative process no matter how obvious it may be that a busy Congress has acted precipitately, I see no reason why the character of their procedures may not be considered relevant to the decision whether the legislative product has caused a deprivation of liberty or property without due process of law. n26 Whenever Congress creates a classification that would be subject to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if it had been fashioned by a state legislature, it seems to me that judicial review should include a consideration of the procedural character of the decisionmaking process. n27 A holding that the classification was not adequately preceded by a consideration of less drastic alternatives or adequately explained by a statement of legislative purpose would be far less intrusive than a final determination that the substance of the decision is not \\u201cnarrowly tailored to the achievement of that goal.\\u201d n28 Cf. THE CHIEF JUSTICE\\u2019s opinion, ante, at 480; MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL\\u2019s opinion concurring in the judgment, ante, at 521. If the general language of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment authorizes this Court to review Acts of Congress under the standards of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \\u2014 a clause that cannot be found in the Fifth Amendment \\u2014 there can be no separation-of-powers objection to a more tentative holding of unconstitutionality based on a failure to follow procedures that guarantee the kind of deliberation that a fundamental constitutional issue of this kind obviously merits. n29\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn26 \\u201cIt is not a new thought that \\u2018to guarantee the democratic legitimacy of political decisions by establishing essential rules for the political process\\u2019 is the central function of judicial review, as Dean Rostow and Professor Strong, among others, have argued.\\u201d Linde, supra, 55 Neb. L. Rev., at 251.\\n\\nn27 See Sandalow, Judicial Protection of Minorities, 75 Mich. L. Rev. 1162, 1188 (1977):\\n\\n\\u201c[If] governmental action trenches upon values that may reasonably be regarded as fundamental, that action should be the product of a deliberate and broadly based political judgment. The stronger the argument that governmental action does encroach upon such values, the greater the need to assure that it is the product of a process that is entitled to speak for the society. Legislation that has failed to engage the attention of Congress, like the decisions of subordinate governmental institutions, does not meet that test, for it is likely to be the product of partial political pressures that are not broadly reflective of the society as a whole.\\u201d\\n\\nn28 \\u201cFear of legislative resentment at judicial interference is not borne out by experience where procedural review exists, any more than it was after the Supreme Court told Congress that it had used faulty procedure in unseating Representative Adam Clayton Powell. It is far more cause for resentment to invalidate the substance of a policy that the politically accountable branches and their constituents support than to invalidate a lawmaking procedure that can be repeated correctly, yet we take substantive judicial review for granted. Strikingly, the reverse view of propriety prevails in a number of nations where courts have never been empowered to set aside policies legitimately enacted into law but do have power to test the process of legitimate enactment.\\u201d Linde, supra, 55 Neb. L. Rev., at 243 (footnotes omitted).\\n\\nn29 The conclusion to THE CHIEF JUSTICE\\u2019s opinion states:\\n\\n\\u201cAny preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination to make sure that it does not conflict with constitutional guarantees.\\u201d Ante, at 491 (emphasis added).\\n\\nI agree with this statement but it seems to me that due process requires that the \\u201cmost searching examination\\u201d be conducted in the first instance by Congress rather than by a federal court.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nIn all events, rather than take the substantive position expressed in MR. JUSTICE STEWART\\u2019s dissenting opinion, I would hold this statute unconstitutional on a narrower ground. It cannot fairly be characterized as a \\u201cnarrowly tailored\\u201d racial classification because it simply raises too many serious questions that Congress failed to answer or even to address in a responsible way. n30 The risk that habitual attitudes toward classes of persons, rather than analysis of the relevant characteristics of the class, will serve as a basis for a legislative classification is present when benefits are distributed as well as when burdens are imposed. In the past, traditional attitudes too often provided the only explanation for discrimination against women, aliens, illegitimates, and black citizens. Today there is a danger that awareness of past injustice will lead to automatic acceptance of new classifications that are not in fact justified by attributes characteristic of the class as a whole.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn30 For example, why were there six racial classifications, and no others, included in the preferred class? Why are aliens excluded from the preference although they are not otherwise ineligible for public contracts? What percentage of Oriental blood or what degree of Spanish-speaking skill is required for membership in the preferred class? How does the legacy of slavery and the history of discrimination against the descendants of its victims support a preference for Spanish-speaking citizens who may be directly competing with black citizens in some overpopulated communities? Why is a preference given only to owners of business enterprises and why is that preference unaccompanied by any requirement concerning the employment of disadvantaged persons? Is the preference limited to a subclass of persons who can prove that they are subject to a special disability caused by past discrimination, as the Court\\u2019s opinion indicates? Or is every member of the racial class entitled to a preference as the statutory language seems plainly to indicate? Are businesses formed just to take advantage of the preference eligible?\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nWhen Congress creates a special preference, or a special disability, for a class of persons, it should identify the characteristic that justifies the special treatment. n31 When the classification is defined in racial terms, I believe that such particular identification is imperative.\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 Footnotes \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nn31 \\u201cOf course, a general rule may not define the benefited class by reference to a distinction which irrationally differentiates between identically situated persons. Differences in race, religion, or political affiliation could not rationally justify a difference in eligibility for social security benefits, for such differences are totally irrelevant to the question whether one person is economically dependent on another. But a distinction between married persons and unmarried persons is of a different character.\\u201d Califano v. Jobst, 434 U.S. 47, 53.\\n\\n\\u201cIf there is no group characteristic that explains the discrimination, one can only conclude that it is without any justification that has not already been rejected by the Court.\\u201d Foley v. Connelie, 435 U.S. 291, 312 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\\n\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 End Footnotes- \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n\\nIn this case, only two conceivable bases for differentiating the preferred classes from society as a whole have occurred to me: (1) that they were the victims of unfair treatment in the past and (2) that they are less able to compete in the future. Although the first of these factors would justify an appropriate remedy for past wrongs, for reasons that I have already stated, this statute is not such a remedial measure. The second factor is simply not true. Nothing in the record of this case, the legislative history of the Act, or experience that we may notice judicially provides any support for such a proposition. It is up to Congress to demonstrate that its unique statutory preference is justified by a relevant characteristic that is shared by the members of the preferred class. In my opinion, because it has failed to make that demonstration, it has also failed to discharge its duty to govern impartially embodied in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\n\\nI respectfully dissent.\\n\",\n          \"(1887) DAWES SEVERALTY ACT\\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That in all cases where any tribe or band of Indians has been, or shall hereafter be, located upon any reservation created for their use, either by treaty stipulation or by virtue of an act of Congress or executive order setting apart the same for their use, the President of the United States be, and he hereby is, authorized, whenever in his opinion any reservation or any part thereof of such Indians is advantageous for agricultural and grazing purposes, to cause said reservation, or any part thereof, to be surveyed, or resurveyed if necessary, and to allot the lands in said reservation in severalty to any Indian located thereon in quantities as follows:\\nTo each head of a family, one-quarter of a section;\\n\\nTo each single person over eighteen years of age, one-eighth of a section;\\n\\nTo each orphan child under eighteen years of age, one-eighth of a section; and\\n\\nTo each other single person under eighteen years now living, or who may be born prior to the date of the order of the President directing an allotment of the lands embraced in any reservation, one-sixteenth of a section: Provided, That in case there is not sufficient land in any of said reservations to allot lands to each individual of the classes above named in quantities as above provided, the lands embraced in such reservation or reservations shall be allotted to each individual of each of said classes pro rata in accordance with the provisions of this act: And provided further, That where the treaty or act of Congress setting apart such reservation provides for the allotment of lands in severalty in quantities in excess of those herein provided, the President, in making allotments upon such reservation, shall allot the lands to each individual Indian belonging thereon in quantity as specified in such treaty or act: And provided further, That when the lands allotted are only valuable for grazing purposes, an additional allotment of such grazing lands, in quantities as above provided, shall be made to each individual.\\n\\n\\u00a72. That all allotments set apart under the provisions of this act shall be selected by the Indians, heads of families selecting for their minor children, and the agents shall select for each orphan child, and in such manner as to embrace the improvements of the Indians making the selection. Where the improvements of two or more Indians have been made on the same legal subdivision of land, unless they shall otherwise agree, a provisional line may be run dividing said lands between them, and the amount to which each is entitled shall be equalized in the assignment of the remainder of the land to which they are entitled under this act: Provided, That if any one entitled to an allotment shall fail to make a selection within four years after the President shall direct that allotments may be made on a particular reservation, the Secretary of the Interior may direct the agent of such tribe or band, if such there be, and if there be no agent, then a special agent appointed for that purpose, to make a selection for such Indian, which election shall be allotted as in cases where selections are made by the Indians, and patents shall issue in like manner.\\n\\n\\u00a73. That the allotments provided for in this act shall be made by special agents appointed by the President for such purpose, and the agents in charge of the respective reservations on which the allotments are directed to be made, under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may from time to time prescribe, and shall be certified by such agents to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in duplicate, one copy to be retained in the Indian Office and the other to be transmitted to the Secretary of the Interior for his action, and to be deposited in the General Land Office.\\n\\n\\u00a74. That where any Indian not residing upon a reservation, or for whose tribe no reservation has been provided by treaty, act of Congress, or executive order, shall make settlement upon any surveyed or unsurveyed lands of the United States not otherwise appropriated, he or she shall be entitled, upon application to the local land-office for the district in which the lands are located, to have the same allotted to him or her, and to his or her children, in quantities and manner as provided in this act for Indians residing upon reservations; and when such settlement is made upon unsurveyed lands, the grant to such Indians shall be adjusted upon the survey of the lands so as to conform thereto; and patents shall be issued to them for such lands in the manner and with the restrictions as herein provided. And the fees to which the officers of such local land-office would have been entitled had such lands been entered under the general laws for the disposition of the public lands shall be paid to them, from any moneys in the Treasury of the United States not otherwise appropriated, upon a statement of an account in their behalf for such fees by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and a certification of such account to the Secretary of the Treasury by the Secretary of the Interior.\\n\\n\\u00a75. That upon the approval of the allotments provided for in this act by the Secretary of the Interior, he shall cause patents to issue therefor in the name of the allottees, which patents shall be of the legal effect, and declare that the United States does and will hold the land thus allotted, for the period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotment shall have been made, or, in case of his decease, of his heirs according to the laws of the State or Territory where such land is located, and that at the expiration of said period the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian, or his heirs as aforesaid, in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever: Provided, That the President of the United States may in any case in his discretion extend the period. And if any conveyance shall be made of the lands set apart and allotted as herein provided, or any contract made touching the same, before the expiration of the time above mentioned, such conveyance or contract shall be absolutely null and void: Provided, That the law of descent and partition in force in the State or Territory where such lands are situated shall apply thereto after patents therefor have been executed and delivered, except as herein otherwise provided; and the laws of the State of Kansas regulating the descent and partition of real estate shall, so far as practicable, apply to all lands in the Indian Territory which may be allotted in severalty under the provisions of this act: And provided further, That at any time after lands have been allotted to all the Indians of any tribe as herein provided, or sooner if in the opinion of the President it shall be for the best interests of said tribe, it shall be lawful for the Secretary of the Interior to negotiate with such Indian tribe for the purchase and release by said tribe, in conformity with the treaty or statute under which such reservation is held, of such portions of its reservation not allotted as such tribe shall, from time to time, consent to sell, on such terms and conditions as shall be considered just and equitable between the United States and said tribe of Indians, which purchase shall not be complete until ratified by Congress, and the form and manner of executing such release shall also be prescribed by Congress: Provided however,\\n\\nThat all lands adapted to agriculture, with or without irrigation so sold or released to the United States by any Indian tribe shall be held by the United States for the sole purpose of securing homes to actual settlers and shall be disposed of by the United States to actual and bona fide settlers only in tracts not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres to any one person, on such terms as Congress shall prescribe, subject to grants which Congress may make in aid of education: And provided further, That no patents shall issue therefor except to the person so taking the same as and for a homestead, or his heirs, and after the expiration of five years occupancy thereof as such homestead; and any conveyance of said lands so taken as a homestead, or any contract touching the same, or lien thereon, created prior to the date of such patent, shall be null and void. And the sums agreed to be paid by the United States as purchase money for any portion of any such reservation shall be held in the Treasury of the United States for the sole use of the tribe or tribes of Indians; to whom such reservations belonged; and the same, with interest thereon at three per cent per annum, shall be at all times subject to appropriation by Congress for the education and civilization of such tribe or tribes of Indians or the members thereof. The patents aforesaid shall be recorded in the General Land Office, and afterward delivered, free of charge, to the allottee entitled thereto. And if any religious society or other organization is now occupying any of the public lands to which this act is applicable, for religious or educational work among the Indians, the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to confirm such occupation to such society or organization, in quantity not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres in any one tract, so long as the same shall be so occupied, on such terms as he shall deem just; but nothing herein contained shall change or alter any claim of such society for religious or educational purposes heretofore granted by law. And hereafter in the employment of Indian police, or any other employees in the public service among any of the Indian tribes or bands affected by this act, and where Indians can perform the duties required, those Indians who have availed themselves of the provisions of this act and become citizens of the United States shall be preferred.\\n\\n\\u00a76. That upon the completion of said allotments and the patenting of the lands to said allottees, each and every member of the respective bands or tribes of Indians to whom allotments have been made shall have the benefit of and be subject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the State or Territory in which they may reside; and no Territory shall pass or enforce any law denying any such Indian within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.

BOLLINGER ET AL\\nNo. 02-241. Argued April 1, 2003\\u2013Decided June 23, 2003\\n\\nThe University of Michigan Law School (Law School), one of the Nation\\u2019s top law schools, follows an official admissions policy that seeks to achieve student body diversity through compliance with Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265. Focusing on students\\u2019 academic ability coupled with a flexible assessment of their talents, experiences, and potential, the policy requires admissions officials to evaluate each applicant based on all the information available in the file, including a personal statement, letters of recommendation, an essay describing how the applicant will contribute to Law School life and diversity, and the applicant\\u2019s undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) score. Additionally, officials must look beyond grades and scores to so-called \\u201csoft variables,\\u201d such as recommenders\\u2019 enthusiasm, the quality of the undergraduate institution and the applicant\\u2019s essay, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course selection. The policy does not define diversity solely in terms of racial and ethnic status and does not restrict the types of diversity contributions eligible for \\u201csubstantial weight,\\u201d but it does reaffirm the Law School\\u2019s commitment to diversity with special reference to the inclusion of African-American, Hispanic, and Native-American students, who otherwise might not be represented in the student body in meaningful numbers. By enrolling a \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d of underrepresented minority students, the policy seeks to ensure their ability to contribute to the Law School\\u2019s character and to the legal profession.\\nWhen the Law School denied admission to petitioner Grutter, a white Michigan resident with a 3.8 GPA and 161 LSAT score, she filed this suit, alleging that respondents had discriminated against her on the basis of race in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and 42 U. S. C. \\u00a71981; that she was rejected because the Law School uses race as a \\u201cpredominant\\u201d factor, giving applicants belonging to certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of admission than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups; and that respondents had no compelling interest to justify that use of race. The District Court found the Law School\\u2019s use of race as an admissions factor unlawful. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion in Bakke was binding precedent establishing diversity as a compelling state interest, and that the Law School\\u2019s use of race was narrowly tailored because race was merely a \\u201cpotential \\u2018plus\\u2019 factor\\u201d and because the Law School\\u2019s program was virtually identical to the Harvard admissions program described approvingly by Justice Powell and appended to his Bakke opinion.\\nHeld: The Law School\\u2019s narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body is not prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause, Title VI, or \\u00a71981. Pp. 9-32.\\n(a) In the landmark Bakke case, this Court reviewed a medical school\\u2019s racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out of 100 seats for members of certain minority groups. The decision produced six separate opinions, none of which commanded a majority. Four Justices would have upheld the program on the ground that the government can use race to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice. 438 U. S., at 325. Four other Justices would have struck the program down on statutory grounds. Id., at 408. Justice Powell, announcing the Court\\u2019s judgment, provided a fifth vote not only for invalidating the program, but also for reversing the state court\\u2019s injunction against any use of race whatsoever. In a part of his opinion that was joined by no other Justice, Justice Powell expressed his view that attaining a diverse student body was the only interest asserted by the university that survived scrutiny. Id., at 311. Grounding his analysis in the academic freedom that \\u201clong has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment,\\u201d id., at 312, 314, Justice Powell emphasized that the \\u201d \\u2018nation\\u2019s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure\\u2019 to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation.\\u201d Id., at 313. However, he also emphasized that \\u201c[i]t is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups,\\u201d that can justify using race. Id., at 315. Rather, \\u201c[t]he diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.\\u201d Ibid. Since Bakke, Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion has been the touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies. Public and private universities across the Nation have modeled their own admissions programs on Justice Powell\\u2019s views. Courts, however, have struggled to discern whether Justice Powell\\u2019s diversity rationale is binding precedent. The Court finds it unnecessary to decide this issue because the Court endorses Justice Powell\\u2019s view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest in the context of university admissions. Pp. 9-13.\\n(b) All government racial classifications must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 227. But not all such uses are invalidated by strict scrutiny. Race-based action necessary to further a compelling governmental interest does not violate the Equal Protection Clause so long as it is narrowly tailored to further that interest. E.g., Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 908. Context matters when reviewing such action. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 343-344. Not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable, and strict scrutiny is designed to provide a framework for carefully examining the importance and the sincerity of the government\\u2019s reasons for using race in a particular context. 13-15.\\n(c) The Court endorses Justice Powell\\u2019s view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify using race in university admissions. The Court defers to the Law School\\u2019s educational judgment that diversity is essential to its educational mission. The Court\\u2019s scrutiny of that interest is no less strict for taking into account complex educational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the university\\u2019s expertise. See, e.g., Bakke, 438 U. S., at 319, n. 53 (opinion of Powell, J.). Attaining a diverse student body is at the heart of the Law School\\u2019s proper institutional mission, and its \\u201cgood faith\\u201d is \\u201cpresumed\\u201d absent \\u201ca showing to the contrary.\\u201d Id., at 318-319. Enrolling a \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d of minority students simply to assure some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin would be patently unconstitutional. E.g., id., at 307. But the Law School defines its critical mass concept by reference to the substantial, important, and laudable educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce, including cross-racial understanding and the breaking down of racial stereotypes. The Law School\\u2019s claim is further bolstered by numerous expert studies and reports showing that such diversity promotes learning outcomes and better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce, for society, and for the legal profession. Major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today\\u2019s increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints. High-ranking retired officers and civilian military leaders assert that a highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps is essential to national security. Moreover, because universities, and in particular, law schools, represent the training ground for a large number of the Nation\\u2019s leaders, Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629, 634, the path to leadership must be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity. Thus, the Law School has a compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body. 15-21.\\n(d) The Law School\\u2019s admissions program bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan. To be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot \\u201cinsulat[e] each category of applicants with certain desired qualifications from competition with all other applicants.\\u201d Bakke, supra, at 315 (opinion of Powell, J.). Instead, it may consider race or ethnicity only as a \\u201d \\u2018plus\\u2019 in a particular applicant\\u2019s file\\u201d; i.e., it must be \\u201cflexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight,\\u201d id., at 317. It follows that universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial or ethnic groups or put them on separate admissions tracks. See id., at 315-316. The Law School\\u2019s admissions program, like the Harvard plan approved by Justice Powell, satisfies these requirements. Moreover, the program is flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes race or ethnicity the defining feature of the application. See Bakke, supra, at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.). The Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant\\u2019s file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment. There is no policy, either de jure or de facto, of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any single \\u201csoft\\u201d variable. Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, p. ___, distinguished. Also, the program adequately ensures that all factors that may contribute to diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race. Moreover, the Law School frequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected. The Court rejects the argument that the Law School should have used other race-neutral means to obtain the educational benefits of student body diversity, e.g., a lottery system or decreasing the emphasis on GPA and LSAT scores. Narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative or mandate that a university choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence or fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities to members of all racial groups. See, e.g., Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 280, n. 6. The Court is satisfied that the Law School adequately considered the available alternatives. The Court is also satisfied that, in the context of individualized consideration of the possible diversity contributions of each applicant, the Law School\\u2019s race-conscious admissions program does not unduly harm nonminority applicants. Finally, race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time. The Court takes the Law School at its word that it would like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of racial preferences as soon as practicable. The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today. Pp. 21-31.\\n(e) Because the Law School\\u2019s use of race in admissions decisions is not prohibited by Equal Protection Clause, petitioner\\u2019s statutory claims based on Title VI and \\u00a71981 also fail.

It receives more than 3,500 applications each year for a class of around 350 students. Seeking to \\u201cadmit a group of students who individually and collectively are among the most capable,\\u201d the Law School looks for individuals with \\u201csubstantial promise for success in law school\\u201d and \\u201ca strong likelihood of succeeding in the practice of law and contributing in diverse ways to the well-being of others.\\u201d App. 110. More broadly, the Law School seeks \\u201ca mix of students with varying backgrounds and experiences who will respect and learn from each other.\\u201d Ibid. In 1992, the dean of the Law School charged a\\nfaculty committee with crafting a written admissions policy to implement these goals. In particular, the Law School sought to ensure that its efforts to achieve student body diversity complied with this Court\\u2019s most recent ruling on the use of race in university admissions. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978). Upon the unanimous adoption of the committee\\u2019s report by the Law School faculty, it became the Law School\\u2019s official admissions policy.\\nThe hallmark of that policy is its focus on academic ability coupled with a flexible assessment of applicants\\u2019 talents, experiences, and potential \\u201cto contribute to the learning of those around them.\\u201d App. 111. The policy requires admissions officials to evaluate each applicant based on all the information available in the file, including a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and diversity of the Law School. Id., at 83-84, 114-121. In reviewing an applicant\\u2019s file, admissions officials must consider the applicant\\u2019s undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) score because they are important (if imperfect) predictors of academic success in law school. Id., at 112. The policy stresses that \\u201cno applicant should be admitted unless we expect that applicant to do well enough to graduate with no serious academic problems.\\u201d Id., at 111.\\nThe policy makes clear, however, that even the highest possible score does not guarantee admission to the Law School. Id., at 113. Nor does a low score automatically disqualify an applicant. Ibid. Rather, the policy requires admissions officials to look beyond grades and test scores to other criteria that are important to the Law School\\u2019s educational objectives. Id., at 114. So-called \\u201d \\u2018soft\\u2019 variables\\u201d such as \\u201cthe enthusiasm of recommenders, the quality of the undergraduate institution, the quality of the applicant\\u2019s essay, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course selection\\u201d are all brought to bear in assessing an \\u201capplicant\\u2019s likely contributions to the intellectual and social life of the institution.\\u201d Ibid.\\nThe policy aspires to \\u201cachieve that diversity which has the potential to enrich everyone\\u2019s education and thus make a law school class stronger than the sum of its parts.\\u201d Id., at 118. The policy does not restrict the types of diversity contributions eligible for \\u201csubstantial weight\\u201d in the admissions process, but instead recognizes \\u201cmany possible bases for diversity admissions.\\u201d Id., at 118, 120. The policy does, however, reaffirm the Law School\\u2019s longstanding commitment to \\u201cone particular type of diversity,\\u201d that is, \\u201cracial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against, like African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, who without this commitment might not be represented in our student body in meaningful numbers.\\u201d Id., at 120. By enrolling a \\u201d \\u2018critical mass\\u2019 of [underrepresented] minority students,\\u201d the Law School seeks to \\u201censur[e] their ability to make unique contributions to the character of the Law School.\\u201d Id., at 120-121.\\nThe policy does not define diversity \\u201csolely in terms of racial and ethnic status.\\u201d Id., at 121. Nor is the policy \\u201cinsensitive to the competition among all students for admission to the [L]aw [S]chool.\\u201d Ibid. Rather, the policy seeks to guide admissions officers in \\u201cproducing classes both diverse and academically outstanding, classes made up of students who promise to continue the tradition of outstanding contribution by Michigan Graduates to the legal profession.\\u201d Ibid.\\nB\\nPetitioner Barbara Grutter is a white Michigan resident who applied to the Law School in 1996 with a 3.8 grade point average and 161 LSAT score. The Law School initially placed petitioner on a waiting list, but subsequently rejected her application. In December 1997, petitioner filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the Law School, the Regents of the University of Michigan, Lee Bollinger (Dean of the Law School from 1987 to 1994, and President of the University of Michigan from 1996 to 2002), Jeffrey Lehman (Dean of the Law School), and Dennis Shields (Director of Admissions at the Law School from 1991 until 1998). Petitioner alleged that respondents discriminated against her on the basis of race in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C. \\u00a72000d; and Rev. Stat. \\u00a71977, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \\u00a71981.\\nPetitioner further alleged that her application was rejected because the Law School uses race as a \\u201cpredominant\\u201d factor, giving applicants who belong to certain minority groups \\u201ca significantly greater chance of admission than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups.\\u201d App. 33-34. Petitioner also alleged that respondents \\u201chad no compelling interest to justify their use of race in the admissions process.\\u201d Id., at 34. Petitioner requested compensatory and punitive damages, an order requiring the Law School to offer her admission, and an injunction prohibiting the Law School from continuing to discriminate on the basis of race. Id., at 36. Petitioner clearly has standing to bring this lawsuit. Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S. 656, 666 (1993).\\nThe District Court granted petitioner\\u2019s motion for class certification and for bifurcation of the trial into liability and damages phases. The class was defined as \\u201d \\u2018all persons who (A) applied for and were not granted admission to the University of Michigan Law School for the academic years since (and including) 1995 until the time that judgment is entered herein; and (B) were members of those racial or ethnic groups, including Caucasian, that Defendants treated less favorably in considering their applications for admission to the Law School.\\u2019 \\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a-192a.\\nThe District Court heard oral argument on the parties\\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment on December 22, 2000. Taking the motions under advisement, the District Court indicated that it would decide as a matter of law whether the Law School\\u2019s asserted interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body was compelling. The District Court also indicated that it would conduct a bench trial on the extent to which race was a factor in the Law School\\u2019s admissions decisions, and whether the Law School\\u2019s consideration of race in admissions decisions constituted a race-based double standard.\\nDuring the 15-day bench trial, the parties introduced extensive evidence concerning the Law School\\u2019s use of race in the admissions process. Dennis Shields, Director of Admissions when petitioner applied to the Law School, testified that he did not direct his staff to admit a particular percentage or number of minority students, but rather to consider an applicant\\u2019s race along with all other factors. Id., at 206a. Shields testified that at the height of the admissions season, he would frequently consult the so-called \\u201cdaily reports\\u201d that kept track of the racial and ethnic composition of the class (along with other information such as residency status and gender). Id., at 207a. This was done, Shields testified, to ensure that a critical mass of underrepresented minority students would be reached so as to realize the educational benefits of a diverse student body. Ibid. Shields stressed, however, that he did not seek to admit any particular number or percentage of underrepresented minority students. Ibid.\\nErica Munzel, who succeeded Shields as Director of Admissions, testified that \\u201d \\u2018critical mass\\u2019 \\u201d means \\u201d \\u2018meaningful numbers\\u2019 \\u201d or \\u201d \\u2018meaningful representation,\\u2019 \\u201d which she understood to mean a number that encourages underrepresented minority students to participate in the classroom and not feel isolated. Id., at 208a-209a. Munzel stated there is no number, percentage, or range of numbers or percentages that constitute critical mass. Id., at 209a. Munzel also asserted that she must consider the race of applicants because a critical mass of underrepresented minority students could not be enrolled if admissions decisions were based primarily on undergraduate GPAs and LSAT scores. Ibid.\\nThe current Dean of the Law School, Jeffrey Lehman, also testified. Like the other Law School witnesses, Lehman did not quantify critical mass in terms of numbers or percentages. Id., at 211a. He indicated that critical mass means numbers such that underrepresented minority students do not feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race. Ibid. When asked about the extent to which race is considered in admissions, Lehman testified that it varies from one applicant to another. Ibid. In some cases, according to Lehman\\u2019s testimony, an applicant\\u2019s race may play no role, while in others it may be a \\u201d \\u2018determinative\\u2019 \\u201d factor. Ibid.\\nThe District Court heard extensive testimony from Professor Richard Lempert, who chaired the faculty committee that drafted the 1992 policy. Lempert emphasized that the Law School seeks students with diverse interests and backgrounds to enhance classroom discussion and the educational experience both inside and outside the classroom. Id., at 213a. When asked about the policy\\u2019s \\u201d \\u2018commitment to racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against,\\u2019 \\u201d Lempert explained that this language did not purport to remedy past discrimination, but rather to include students who may bring to the Law School a perspective different from that of members of groups which have not been the victims of such discrimination. Ibid. Lempert acknowledged that other groups, such as Asians and Jews, have experienced discrimination, but explained they were not mentioned in the policy because individuals who are members of those groups were already being admitted to the Law School in significant numbers. Ibid.\\nKent Syverud was the final witness to testify about the Law School\\u2019s use of race in admissions decisions. Syverud was a professor at the Law School when the 1992 admissions policy was adopted and is now Dean of Vanderbilt Law School. In addition to his testimony at trial, Syverud submitted several expert reports on the educational benefits of diversity. Syverud\\u2019s testimony indicated that when a critical mass of underrepresented minority students is present, racial stereotypes lose their force because nonminority students learn there is no \\u201d \\u2018minority viewpoint\\u2019 \\u201d but rather a variety of viewpoints among minority students. Id., at 215a.\\nIn an attempt to quantify the extent to which the Law School actually considers race in making admissions decisions, the parties introduced voluminous evidence at trial. Relying on data obtained from the Law School, petitioner\\u2019s expert, Dr. Kinley Larntz, generated and analyzed \\u201cadmissions grids\\u201d for the years in question (1995-2000). These grids show the number of applicants and the number of admittees for all combinations of GPAs and LSAT scores. Dr. Larntz made \\u201d \\u2018cell-by-cell\\u2019 \\u201d comparisons between applicants of different races to determine whether a statistically significant relationship existed between race and admission rates. He concluded that membership in certain minority groups \\u201d \\u2018is an extremely strong factor in the decision for acceptance,\\u2019 \\u201d and that applicants from these minority groups \\u201d \\u2018are given an extremely large allowance for admission\\u2019 \\u201d as compared to applicants who are members of nonfavored groups. Id., at 218a-220a. Dr. Larntz conceded, however, that race is not the predominant factor in the Law School\\u2019s admissions calculus. 12 Tr. 11-13 (Feb. 10, 2001).\\nDr. Stephen Raudenbush, the Law School\\u2019s expert, focused on the predicted effect of eliminating race as a factor in the Law School\\u2019s admission process. In Dr. Raudenbush\\u2019s view, a race-blind admissions system would have a \\u201d \\u2018very dramatic,\\u2019 \\u201d negative effect on underrepresented minority admissions. App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a. He testified that in 2000, 35 percent of underrepresented minority applicants were admitted. Ibid. Dr. Raudenbush predicted that if race were not considered, only 10 percent of those applicants would have been admitted. Ibid. Under this scenario, underrepresented minority students would have comprised 4 percent of the entering class in 2000 instead of the actual figure of 14.5 percent. Ibid.\\nIn the end, the District Court concluded that the Law School\\u2019s use of race as a factor in admissions decisions was unlawful. Applying strict scrutiny, the District Court determined that the Law School\\u2019s asserted interest in assembling a diverse student body was not compelling because \\u201cthe attainment of a racially diverse class \\u2026 was not recognized as such by Bakke and is not a remedy for past discrimination.\\u201d Id., at 246a. The District Court went on to hold that even if diversity were compelling, the Law School had not narrowly tailored its use of race to further that interest. The District Court granted petitioner\\u2019s request for declaratory relief and enjoined the Law School from using race as a factor in its admissions decisions. The Court of Appeals entered a stay of the injunction pending appeal.\\nSitting en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\\u2019s judgment and vacated the injunction. The Court of Appeals first held that Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion in Bakke was binding precedent establishing diversity as a compelling state interest. According to the Court of Appeals, Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion with respect to diversity comprised the controlling rationale for the judgment of this Court under the analysis set forth in Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188 (1977). The Court of Appeals also held that the Law School\\u2019s use of race was narrowly tailored because race was merely a \\u201cpotential \\u2018plus\\u2019 factor\\u201d and because the Law School\\u2019s program was \\u201cvirtually identical\\u201d to the Harvard admissions program described approvingly by Justice Powell and appended to his Bakke opinion. 288 F. 3d 732, 746, 749 (CA6 2002).\\nFour dissenting judges would have held the Law School\\u2019s use of race unconstitutional. Three of the dissenters, rejecting the majority\\u2019s Marks analysis, examined the Law School\\u2019s interest in student body diversity on the merits and concluded it was not compelling. The fourth dissenter, writing separately, found it unnecessary to decide whether diversity was a compelling interest because, like the other dissenters, he believed that the Law School\\u2019s use of race was not narrowly tailored to further that interest.\\nWe granted certiorari, 537 U. S. 1043 (2002), to resolve the disagreement among the Courts of Appeals on a question of national importance: Whether diversity is a compelling interest that can justify the narrowly tailored use of race in selecting applicants for admission to public universities. Compare Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F. 3d 932 (CA5 1996) (Hopwood I ) (holding that diversity is not a compelling state interest), with Smith v. University of Wash. Law School, 233 F. 3d 1188 (CA9 2000) (holding that it is).\\nII\\nA\\nWe last addressed the use of race in public higher education over 25 years ago. In the landmark Bakke case, we reviewed a racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out of 100 seats in a medical school class for members of certain minority groups. 438 U. S. 265 (1978). The decision produced six separate opinions, none of which commanded a majority of the Court. Four Justices would have upheld the program against all attack on the ground that the government can use race to \\u201cremedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice.\\u201d Id., at 325 (joint opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Four other Justices avoided the constitutional question altogether and struck down the program on statutory grounds. Id., at 408 (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Stewart and Rehnquist, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Justice Powell provided a fifth vote not only for invalidating the set-aside program, but also for reversing the state court\\u2019s injunction against any use of race whatsoever. The only holding for the Court in Bakke was that a \\u201cState has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.\\u201d Id., at 320. Thus, we reversed that part of the lower court\\u2019s judgment that enjoined the university \\u201cfrom any consideration of the race of any applicant.\\u201d Ibid.\\nSince this Court\\u2019s splintered decision in Bakke, Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion announcing the judgment of the Court has served as the touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies. Public and private universities across the Nation have modeled their own admissions programs on Justice Powell\\u2019s views on permissible race-conscious policies. See, e.g., Brief for Judith Areen et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13 (law school admissions programs employ \\u201cmethods designed from and based on Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion in Bakke\\u201d); Brief for Amherst College et al. as Amici Curiae 27 (\\u201cAfter Bakke, each of the amici (and undoubtedly other selective colleges and universities as well) reviewed their admissions procedures in light of Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion \\u2026 and set sail accordingly\\u201d). We therefore discuss Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion in some detail.\\nJustice Powell began by stating that \\u201c[t]he guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color. If both are not accorded the same protection, then it is not equal.\\u201d Bakke, 438 U. S., at 289-\\n290. In Justice Powell\\u2019s view, when governmental decisions \\u201ctouch upon an individual\\u2019s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.\\u201d Id., at 299. Under this exacting standard, only one of the interests asserted by the university survived Justice Powell\\u2019s scrutiny.\\nFirst, Justice Powell rejected an interest in \\u201d \\u2018reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession\\u2019 \\u201d as an unlawful interest in racial balancing. Id., at 306-307. Second, Justice Powell rejected an interest in remedying societal discrimination because such measures would risk placing unnecessary burdens on innocent third parties \\u201cwho bear no responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the special admissions program are thought to have suffered.\\u201d Id., at 310. Third, Justice Powell rejected an interest in \\u201cincreasing the number of physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved,\\u201d concluding that even if such an interest could be compelling in some circumstances the program under review was not \\u201cgeared to promote that goal.\\u201d Id., at 306, 310.\\nJustice Powell approved the university\\u2019s use of race to further only one interest: \\u201cthe attainment of a diverse student body.\\u201d Id., at 311. With the important proviso that \\u201cconstitutional limitations protecting individual rights may not be disregarded,\\u201d Justice Powell grounded his analysis in the academic freedom that \\u201clong has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment.\\u201d Id., at 312, 314. Justice Powell emphasized that nothing less than the \\u201d \\u2018nation\\u2019s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure\\u2019 to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.\\u201d Id., at 313 (quoting Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 603 (1967)). In seeking the \\u201cright to select those students who will contribute the most to the \\u2018robust exchange of ideas,\\u2019 \\u201d a university seeks \\u201cto achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission.\\u201d 438 U. S., at 313. Both \\u201ctradition and experience lend support to the view that the contribution of diversity is substantial.\\u201d Ibid.\\nJustice Powell was, however, careful to emphasize that in his view race \\u201cis only one element in a range of factors a university properly may consider in attaining the goal of a heterogeneous student body.\\u201d Id., at 314. For Justice Powell, \\u201c[i]t is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups,\\u201d that can justify the use of race. Id., at 315. Rather, \\u201c[t]he diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.\\u201d Ibid.\\nIn the wake of our fractured decision in Bakke, courts have struggled to discern whether Justice Powell\\u2019s diversity rationale, set forth in part of the opinion joined by no other Justice, is nonetheless binding precedent under Marks. In that case, we explained that \\u201c[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\\u201d 430 U. S., at 193 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As the divergent opinions of the lower courts demonstrate, however, \\u201c[t]his test is more easily stated than applied to the various opinions supporting the result in [Bakke].\\u201d Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 745-746 (1994). Compare, e.g., Johnson v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Ga., 263 F. 3d 1234 (CA11 2001) (Justice Powell\\u2019s diversity rationale was not the holding of the Court); Hopwood v. Texas, 236 F. 3d 256, 274-275 (CA5 2000) (Hopwood II ) (same); Hopwood I, 78 F. 3d 932 (same), with Smith v. University of Wash. Law School, 233 F. 3d 1199 (Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion, including the diversity rationale, is controlling under Marks).\\nWe do not find it necessary to decide whether Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion is binding under Marks. It does not seem \\u201cuseful to pursue the Marks inquiry to the utmost logical possibility when it has so obviously baffled and divided the lower courts that have considered it.\\u201d Nichols v. United States, supra, at 745-746. More important, for the reasons set out below, today we endorse Justice Powell\\u2019s view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions.\\nB\\nThe Equal Protection Clause provides that no State shall \\u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, \\u00a72. Because the Fourteenth Amendment \\u201cprotect[s] persons, not groups,\\u201d all \\u201cgovernmental action based on race\\u2013a group classification long recognized as in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited\\u2013should be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed.\\u201d Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995) (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We are a \\u201cfree people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\\u201d Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 11 (1967) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). It follows from that principle that \\u201cgovernment may treat people differently because of their race only for the most compelling reasons.\\u201d Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\\u00f1a, 515 U. S., at 227.\\nWe have held that all racial classifications imposed by government \\u201cmust be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\\u201d Ibid. This means that such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further compelling governmental interests. \\u201cAbsent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures,\\u201d we have no way to determine what \\u201cclassifications are \\u2018benign\\u2019 or \\u2018remedial\\u2019 and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.\\u201d Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion). We apply strict scrutiny to all racial classifications to \\u201d \\u2018smoke out\\u2019 illegitimate uses of race by assuring that [government] is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool.\\u201d Ibid.\\nStrict scrutiny is not \\u201cstrict in theory, but fatal in fact.\\u201d Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\\u00f1a, supra, at 237 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although all governmental uses of race are subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated by it. As we have explained, \\u201cwhenever the government treats any person unequally because of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and spirit of the Constitution\\u2019s guarantee of equal protection.\\u201d 515 U. S., at 229-230. But that observation \\u201csays nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny.\\u201d Id., at 230. When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest, such action does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection so long as the narrow-tailoring requirement is also satisfied.\\nContext matters when reviewing race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 343-344 (1960) (admonishing that, \\u201cin dealing with claims under broad provisions of the Constitution, which derive content by an interpretive process of inclusion and exclusion, it is imperative that generalizations, based on and qualified by the concrete situations that gave rise to them, must not be applied out of context in disregard of variant controlling facts\\u201d). In Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\\u00f1a, we made clear that strict scrutiny must take \\u201d \\u2018relevant differences\\u2019 into account.\\u201d 515 U. S., at 228. Indeed, as we explained, that is its \\u201cfundamental purpose.\\u201d Ibid. Not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable and strict scrutiny is designed to provide a framework for carefully examining the importance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental decisionmaker for the use of race in that particular context.\\nIII\\nA\\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to the question whether the Law School\\u2019s use of race is justified by a compelling state interest. Before this Court, as they have throughout this litigation, respondents assert only one justification for their use of race in the admissions process: obtaining \\u201cthe educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.\\u201d Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. i. In other words, the Law School asks us to recognize, in the context of higher education, a compelling state interest in student body diversity.\\nWe first wish to dispel the notion that the Law School\\u2019s argument has been foreclosed, either expressly or implicitly, by our affirmative-action cases decided since Bakke. It is true that some language in those opinions might be read to suggest that remedying past discrimination is the only permissible justification for race-based governmental action. See, e.g., Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., supra, at 493 (plurality opinion) (stating that unless classifications based on race are \\u201cstrictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility\\u201d). But we have never held that the only governmental use of race that can survive strict scrutiny is remedying past discrimination. Nor, since Bakke, have we directly addressed the use of race in the context of public higher education. Today, we hold that the Law School has a compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body.\\nThe Law School\\u2019s educational judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer. The Law School\\u2019s assessment that diversity will, in fact, yield educational benefits is substantiated by respondents and their amici. Our scrutiny of the interest asserted by the Law School is no less strict for taking into account complex educational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the expertise of the university. Our holding today is in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference to a university\\u2019s academic decisions, within constitutionally prescribed limits. See Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 225 (1985); Board of Curators of Univ. of Mo. v. Horowitz, 435 U. S. 78, 96, n. 6 (1978); Bakke, 438 U. S., at 319, n. 53 (opinion of Powell, J.).\\nWe have long recognized that, given the important purpose of public education and the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment, universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition. See, e.g., Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183, 195 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 250 (1957); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U. S. 479, 487 (1960); Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S., at 603. In announcing the principle of student body diversity as a compelling state interest, Justice Powell invoked our cases recognizing a constitutional dimension, grounded in the First Amendment, of educational autonomy: \\u201cThe freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education includes the selection of its student body.\\u201d Bakke, supra, at 312. From this premise, Justice Powell reasoned that by claiming \\u201cthe right to select those students who will contribute the most to the \\u2018robust exchange of ideas,\\u2019 \\u201d a university \\u201cseek[s] to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission.\\u201d 438 U. S., at 313 (quoting Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., supra, at 603). Our conclusion that the Law School has a compelling interest in a diverse student body is informed by our view that attaining a diverse student body is at the heart of the Law School\\u2019s proper institutional mission, and that \\u201cgood faith\\u201d on the part of a university is \\u201cpresumed\\u201d absent \\u201ca showing to the contrary.\\u201d 438 U. S., at 318-319.\\nAs part of its goal of \\u201cassembling a class that is both exceptionally academically qualified and broadly diverse,\\u201d the Law School seeks to \\u201cenroll a \\u2018critical mass\\u2019 of minority students.\\u201d Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 13. The Law School\\u2019s interest is not simply \\u201cto assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin.\\u201d Bakke, 438 U. S., at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.). That would amount to outright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional. Ibid.; Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 494 (1992) (\\u201cRacial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake\\u201d); Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S., at 507. Rather, the Law School\\u2019s concept of critical mass is defined by reference to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce.\\nThese benefits are substantial. As the District Court emphasized, the Law School\\u2019s admissions policy promotes \\u201ccross-racial understanding,\\u201d helps to break down racial stereotypes, and \\u201cenables [students] to better understand persons of different races.\\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 246a. These benefits are \\u201cimportant and laudable,\\u201d because \\u201cclassroom discussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting\\u201d when the students have \\u201cthe greatest possible variety of backgrounds.\\u201d Id., at 246a, 244a.\\nThe Law School\\u2019s claim of a compelling interest is further bolstered by its amici, who point to the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity. In addition to the expert studies and reports entered into evidence at trial, numerous studies show that student body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and \\u201cbetter prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society, and better prepares them as professionals.\\u201d Brief for American Educational Research Association et al. as Amici Curiae 3; see, e.g., W. Bowen & D. Bok, The Shape of the River (1998); Diversity Challenged: Evidence on the Impact of Affirmative Action (G. Orfield & M. Kurlaender eds. 2001); Compelling Interest: Examining the Evidence on Racial Dynamics in Colleges and Universities (M. Chang, D. Witt, J. Jones, & K. Hakuta eds. 2003).\\nThese benefits are not theoretical but real, as major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today\\u2019s increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints. Brief for 3M et al. as Amici Curiae 5; Brief for General Motors Corp. as Amicus Curiae 3-4. What is more, high-ranking retired officers and civilian leaders of the United States military assert that, \\u201c[b]ased on [their] decades of experience,\\u201d a \\u201chighly qualified, racially diverse officer corps \\u2026 is essential to the military\\u2019s ability to fulfill its principle mission to provide national security.\\u201d Brief for Julius W. Becton, Jr. et al. as Amici Curiae 27. The primary sources for the Nation\\u2019s officer corps are the service academies and the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), the latter comprising students already admitted to participating colleges and universities. Id., at 5. At present, \\u201cthe military cannot achieve an officer corps that is both highly qualified and racially diverse unless the service academies and the ROTC used limited race-conscious recruiting and admissions policies.\\u201d Ibid. (emphasis in original). To fulfill its mission, the military \\u201cmust be selective in admissions for training and education for the officer corps, and it must train and educate a highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps in a racially diverse setting.\\u201d Id., at 29 (emphasis in original). We agree that \\u201c[i]t requires only a small step from this analysis to conclude that our country\\u2019s other most selective institutions must remain both diverse and selective.\\u201d Ibid.\\nWe have repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of preparing students for work and citizenship, describing education as pivotal to \\u201csustaining our political and cultural heritage\\u201d with a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202, 221 (1982). This Court has long recognized that \\u201ceducation \\u2026 is the very foundation of good citizenship.\\u201d Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 493 (1954). For this reason, the diffusion of knowledge and opportunity through public institutions of higher education must be accessible to all individuals regardless of race or ethnicity. The United States, as amicus curiae, affirms that \\u201c[e]nsuring that public institutions are open and available to all segments of American society, including people of all races and ethnicities, represents a paramount government objective.\\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13. And, \\u201c[n]owhere is the importance of such openness more acute than in the context of higher education.\\u201d Ibid. Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our Nation is essential if the dream of one Nation, indivisible, is to be realized.\\nMoreover, universities, and in particular, law schools, represent the training ground for a large number of our Nation\\u2019s leaders. Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629, 634 (1950) (describing law school as a \\u201cproving ground for legal learning and practice\\u201d). Individuals with law degrees occupy roughly half the state governorships, more than half the seats in the United States Senate, and more than a third of the seats in the United States House of Representatives. See Brief for Association of American Law Schools as Amicus Curiae 5-6. The pattern is even more striking when it comes to highly selective law schools. A handful of these schools accounts for 25 of the 100 United States Senators, 74 United States Courts of Appeals judges, and nearly 200 of the more than 600 United States District Court judges. Id., at 6.\\nIn order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity. All members of our heterogeneous society must have confidence in the openness and integrity of the educational institutions that provide this training. As we have recognized, law schools \\u201ccannot be effective in isolation from the individuals and institutions with which the law interacts.\\u201d See Sweatt v. Painter, supra, at 634. Access to legal education (and thus the legal profession) must be inclusive of talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity, so that all members of our heterogeneous society may participate in the educational institutions that provide the training and education necessary to succeed in America.\\nThe Law School does not premise its need for critical mass on \\u201cany belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue.\\u201d Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 30. To the contrary, diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of the Law School\\u2019s mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students. Just as growing up in a particular region or having particular professional experiences is likely to affect an individual\\u2019s views, so too is one\\u2019s own, unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which race unfortunately still matters. The Law School has determined, based on its experience and expertise, that a \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d of underrepresented minorities is necessary to further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.\\nB\\nEven in the limited circumstance when drawing racial distinctions is permissible to further a compelling state interest, government is still \\u201cconstrained in how it may pursue that end: [T]he means chosen to accomplish the [government\\u2019s] asserted purpose must be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that purpose.\\u201d Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 908 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The purpose of the narrow tailoring requirement is to ensure that \\u201cthe means chosen \\u2018fit\\u2019 \\u2026 th[e] compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.\\u201d Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S., at 493 (plurality opinion).\\nSince Bakke, we have had no occasion to define the contours of the narrow-tailoring inquiry with respect to race-conscious university admissions programs. That inquiry must be calibrated to fit the distinct issues raised by the use of race to achieve student body diversity in public higher education. Contrary to Justice Kennedy\\u2019s assertions, we do not \\u201cabandon[ ] strict scrutiny,\\u201d see post, at 8 (dissenting opinion). Rather, as we have already explained, ante, at 15, we adhere to Adarand\\u2019s teaching that the very purpose of strict scrutiny is to take such \\u201d relevant differences into account.\\u201d 515 U. S., at 228 (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nTo be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot use a quota system\\u2013it cannot \\u201cinsulat[e] each category of applicants with certain desired qualifications from competition with all other applicants.\\u201d Bakke, supra, at 315 (opinion of Powell, J.). Instead, a university may consider race or ethnicity only as a \\u201d \\u2018plus\\u2019 in a particular applicant\\u2019s file,\\u201d without \\u201cinsulat[ing] the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats.\\u201d Id., at 317. In other words, an admissions program must be \\u201cflexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight.\\u201d Ibid.\\nWe find that the Law School\\u2019s admissions program bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan. As Justice Powell made clear in Bakke, truly individualized consideration demands that race be used in a flexible, nonmechanical way. It follows from this mandate that universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial groups or put members of those groups on separate admissions tracks. See id., at 315-316. Nor can universities insulate applicants who belong to certain racial or ethnic groups from the competition for admission. Ibid. Universities can, however, consider race or ethnicity more flexibly as a \\u201cplus\\u201d factor in the context of individualized consideration of each and every applicant. Ibid.\\nWe are satisfied that the Law School\\u2019s admissions program, like the Harvard plan described by Justice Powell, does not operate as a quota. Properly understood, a \\u201cquota\\u201d is a program in which a certain fixed number or proportion of opportunities are \\u201creserved exclusively for certain minority groups.\\u201d Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., supra, at 496 (plurality opinion). Quotas \\u201d \\u2018impose a fixed number or percentage which must be attained, or which cannot be exceeded,\\u2019 \\u201d Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 495 (1986) (O\\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and \\u201cinsulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats.\\u201d Bakke, supra, at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.). In contrast, \\u201ca permissible goal \\u2026 require[s] only a good-faith effort \\u2026 to come within a range demarcated by the goal itself,\\u201d Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, supra, at 495, and permits consideration of race as a \\u201cplus\\u201d factor in any given case while still ensuring that each candidate \\u201ccompete[s] with all other qualified applicants,\\u201d Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616, 638 (1987).\\nJustice Powell\\u2019s distinction between the medical school\\u2019s rigid 16-seat quota and Harvard\\u2019s flexible use of race as a \\u201cplus\\u201d factor is instructive. Harvard certainly had minimum goals for minority enrollment, even if it had no specific number firmly in mind. See Bakke, supra, at 323 (opinion of Powell, J.) (\\u201c10 or 20 black students could not begin to bring to their classmates and to each other the variety of points of view, backgrounds and experiences of blacks in the United States\\u201d). What is more, Justice Powell flatly rejected the argument that Harvard\\u2019s program was \\u201cthe functional equivalent of a quota\\u201d merely because it had some \\u201d \\u2018plus\\u2019 \\u201d for race, or gave greater \\u201cweight\\u201d to race than to some other factors, in order to achieve student body diversity. 438 U. S., at 317-318.\\nThe Law School\\u2019s goal of attaining a critical mass of underrepresented minority students does not transform its program into a quota. As the Harvard plan described by Justice Powell recognized, there is of course \\u201csome relationship between numbers and achieving the benefits to be derived from a diverse student body, and between numbers and providing a reasonable environment for those students admitted.\\u201d Id., at 323. \\u201c[S]ome attention to numbers,\\u201d without more, does not transform a flexible admissions system into a rigid quota. Ibid. Nor, as Justice Kennedy posits, does the Law School\\u2019s consultation of the \\u201cdaily reports,\\u201d which keep track of the racial and ethnic composition of the class (as well as of residency and gender), \\u201csuggest[ ] there was no further attempt at individual review save for race itself\\u201d during the final stages of the admissions process. See post, at 6 (dissenting opinion). To the contrary, the Law School\\u2019s admissions officers testified without contradiction that they never gave race any more or less weight based on the information contained in these reports. Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 43, n. 70 (citing App. in Nos. 01-1447 and 01-1516 (CA6), p. 7336). Moreover, as Justice Kennedy concedes, see post, at 4, between 1993 and 2000, the number of African-American, Latino, and Native-American students in each class at the Law School varied from 13.5 to 20.1 percent, a range inconsistent with a quota.\\nThe Chief Justice believes that the Law School\\u2019s policy conceals an attempt to achieve racial balancing, and cites admissions data to contend that the Law School discriminates among different groups within the critical mass. Post, at 3-9 (dissenting opinion). But, as The Chief Justice concedes, the number of underrepresented minority students who ultimately enroll in the Law School differs substantially from their representation in the applicant pool and varies considerably for each group from year to year. See post, at 8 (dissenting opinion).\\nThat a race-conscious admissions program does not operate as a quota does not, by itself, satisfy the requirement of individualized consideration. When using race as a \\u201cplus\\u201d factor in university admissions, a university\\u2019s admissions program must remain flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicant\\u2019s race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application. The importance of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount. See Bakke, supra, at 318, n. 52 (opinion of Powell, J.) (identifying the \\u201cdenial \\u2026 of th[e] right to individualized consideration\\u201d as the \\u201cprincipal evil\\u201d of the medical school\\u2019s admissions program).\\nHere, the Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant\\u2019s file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment. The Law School affords this individualized consideration to applicants of all races. There is no policy, either de jure or de facto, of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any single \\u201csoft\\u201d variable. Unlike the program at issue in Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, the Law School awards no mechanical, predetermined diversity \\u201cbonuses\\u201d based on race or ethnicity. See ante, at 23 (distinguishing a race-conscious admissions program that automatically awards 20 points based on race from the Harvard plan, which considered race but \\u201cdid not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a university\\u2019s diversity\\u201d). Like the Harvard plan, the Law School\\u2019s admissions policy \\u201cis flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight.\\u201d Bakke, supra, at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.).\\nWe also find that, like the Harvard plan Justice Powell referenced in Bakke, the Law School\\u2019s race-conscious admissions program adequately ensures that all factors that may contribute to student body diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race in admissions decisions. With respect to the use of race itself, all underrepresented minority students admitted by the Law School have been deemed qualified. By virtue of our Nation\\u2019s struggle with racial inequality, such students are both likely to have experiences of particular importance to the Law School\\u2019s mission, and less likely to be admitted in meaningful numbers on criteria that ignore those experiences. See App. 120.\\nThe Law School does not, however, limit in any way the broad range of qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable contributions to student body diversity. To the contrary, the 1992 policy makes clear \\u201c[t]here are many possible bases for diversity admissions,\\u201d and provides examples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have had successful careers in other fields. Id., at 118-119. The Law School seriously considers each \\u201capplicant\\u2019s promise of making a notable contribution to the class by way of a particular strength, attainment, or characteristic\\u2013e.g., an unusual intellectual achievement, employment experience, nonacademic performance, or personal background.\\u201d Id., at 83-84. All applicants have the opportunity to highlight their own potential diversity contributions through the submission of a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and diversity of the Law School.\\nWhat is more, the Law School actually gives substantial weight to diversity factors besides race. The Law School frequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected. See Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 10; App. 121-122. This shows that the Law School seriously weighs many other diversity factors besides race that can make a real and dispositive difference for nonminority applicants as well. By this flexible approach, the Law School sufficiently takes into account, in practice as well as in theory, a wide variety of characteristics besides race and ethnicity that contribute to a diverse student body. Justice Kennedy speculates that \\u201crace is likely outcome determinative for many members of minority groups\\u201d who do not fall within the upper range of LSAT scores and grades. Post, at 3 (dissenting opinion). But the same could be said of the Harvard plan discussed approvingly by Justice Powell in Bakke, and indeed of any plan that uses race as one of many factors. See 438 U. S., at 316 (\\u201d \\u2018When the Committee on Admissions reviews the large middle group of applicants who are \\u201cadmissible\\u201d and deemed capable of doing good work in their courses, the race of an applicant may tip the balance in his favor\\u2019 \\u201c).\\nPetitioner and the United States argue that the Law School\\u2019s plan is not narrowly tailored because race-neutral means exist to obtain the educational benefits of student body diversity that the Law School seeks. We disagree. Narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative. Nor does it require a university to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence or fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities to members of all racial groups. See Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 280, n. 6 (1986) (alternatives must serve the interest \\u201d \\u2018about as well\\u2019 \\u201c); Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S., at 509-\\n510 (plurality opinion) (city had a \\u201cwhole array of race-neutral\\u201d alternatives because changing requirements \\u201cwould have [had] little detrimental effect on the city\\u2019s interests\\u201d). Narrow tailoring does, however, require serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the university seeks. See id., at 507 (set-aside plan not narrowly tailored where \\u201cthere does not appear to have been any consideration of the use of race-neutral means\\u201d); Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., supra, at 280, n. 6 (narrow tailoring \\u201crequire[s] consideration\\u201d of \\u201clawful alternative and less restrictive means\\u201d).\\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that the Law School sufficiently considered workable race-neutral alternatives. The District Court took the Law School to task for failing to consider race-neutral alternatives such as \\u201cusing a lottery system\\u201d or \\u201cdecreasing the emphasis for all applicants on undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores.\\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 251a. But these alternatives would require a dramatic sacrifice of diversity, the academic quality of all admitted students, or both.\\nThe Law School\\u2019s current admissions program considers race as one factor among many, in an effort to assemble a student body that is diverse in ways broader than race. Because a lottery would make that kind of nuanced judgment impossible, it would effectively sacrifice all other educational values, not to mention every other kind of diversity. So too with the suggestion that the Law School simply lower admissions standards for all students, a drastic remedy that would require the Law School to become a much different institution and sacrifice a vital component of its educational mission. The United States advocates \\u201cpercentage plans,\\u201d recently adopted by public undergraduate institutions in Texas, Florida, and California to guarantee admission to all students above a certain class-rank threshold in every high school in the State. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14-18. The United States does not, however, explain how such plans could work for graduate and professional schools. More-over, even assuming such plans are race-neutral, they may preclude the university from conducting the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued by the university. We are satisfied that the Law School adequately considered race-neutral alternatives currently capable of producing a critical mass without forcing the Law School to abandon the academic selectivity that is the cornerstone of its educational mission.\\nWe acknowledge that \\u201cthere are serious problems of justice connected with the idea of preference itself.\\u201d Bakke, 438 U. S., at 298 (opinion of Powell, J.). Narrow tailoring, therefore, requires that a race-conscious admissions program not unduly harm members of any racial group. Even remedial race-based governmental action generally \\u201cremains subject to continuing oversight to assure that it will work the least harm possible to other innocent persons competing for the benefit.\\u201d Id., at 308. To be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program must not \\u201cunduly burden individuals who are not members of the favored racial and ethnic groups.\\u201d Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 630 (1990) (O\\u2019Connor, J., dissenting).\\nWe are satisfied that the Law School\\u2019s admissions program does not. Because the Law School considers \\u201call pertinent elements of diversity,\\u201d it can (and does) select nonminority applicants who have greater potential to enhance student body diversity over underrepresented minority applicants. See Bakke, supra, at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.). As Justice Powell recognized in Bakke, so long as a race-conscious admissions program uses race as a \\u201cplus\\u201d factor in the context of individualized consideration, a rejected applicant\\n\\u201cwill not have been foreclosed from all consideration for that seat simply because he was not the right color or had the wrong surname\\u2026 . His qualifications would have been weighed fairly and competitively, and he would have no basis to complain of unequal treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment.\\u201d 438 U. S., at 318.\\nWe agree that, in the context of its individualized inquiry into the possible diversity contributions of all applicants, the Law School\\u2019s race-conscious admissions program does not unduly harm nonminority applicants.\\nWe are mindful, however, that \\u201c[a] core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race.\\u201d Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S. 429, 432 (1984). Accordingly, race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time. This requirement reflects that racial classifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands. Enshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences would offend this fundamental equal protection principle. We see no reason to exempt race-conscious admissions programs from the requirement that all governmental use of race must have a logical end point. The Law School, too, concedes that all \\u201crace-conscious programs must have reasonable durational limits.\\u201d Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 32.\\nIn the context of higher education, the durational requirement can be met by sunset provisions in race-conscious admissions policies and periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity. Universities in California, Florida, and Washington State, where racial preferences in admissions are prohibited by state law, are currently engaged in experimenting with a wide variety of alternative approaches. Universities in other States can and should draw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral alternatives as they develop. Cf. United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 581 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\\u201c[T]he States may perform their role as laboratories for experimentation to devise various solutions where the best solution is far from clear\\u201d).\\nThe requirement that all race-conscious admissions programs have a termination point \\u201cassure[s] all citizens that the deviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and ethnic groups is a temporary matter, a measure taken in the service of the goal of equality itself.\\u201d Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S., at 510 (plurality opinion); see also Nathanson & Bartnik, The Constitutionality of Preferential Treatment for Minority Applicants to Professional Schools, 58 Chicago Bar Rec. 282, 293 (May-June 1977) (\\u201cIt would be a sad day indeed, were America to become a quota-ridden society, with each identifiable minority assigned proportional representation in every desirable walk of life. But that is not the rationale for programs of preferential treatment; the acid test of their justification will be their efficacy in eliminating the need for any racial or ethnic preferences at all\\u201d).\\nWe take the Law School at its word that it would \\u201clike nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula\\u201d and will terminate its race-conscious admissions program as soon as practicable. See Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 34; Bakke, supra, at 317-318 (opinion of Powell, J.) (presuming good faith of university officials in the absence of a showing to the contrary). It has been 25 years since Justice Powell first approved the use of race to further an interest in student body diversity in the context of public higher education. Since that time, the number of minority applicants with high grades and test scores has indeed increased. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 43. We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.\\nIV\\nIn summary, the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the Law School\\u2019s narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body. Consequently, petitioner\\u2019s statutory claims based on Title VI and 42 U. S. C. \\u00a71981 also fail. See Bakke, supra, at 287 (opinion of Powell, J.) (\\u201cTitle VI \\u2026 proscribe[s] only those racial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Fifth Amendment\\u201d); General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389-391 (1982) (the prohibition against discrimination in \\u00a71981 is co-extensive with the Equal Protection Clause). The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, accordingly, is affirmed.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\nBARBARA GRUTTER, PETITIONER v. LEE\\nBOLLINGER et al.\\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of\\nappeals for the sixth circuit\\n[June 23, 2003]\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer joins, concurring.\\nThe Court\\u2019s observation that race-conscious programs \\u201cmust have a logical end point,\\u201d ante, at 29, accords with the international understanding of the office of affirmative action. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, ratified by the United States in 1994, see State Dept., Treaties in Force 422-423 (June 1996), endorses \\u201cspecial and concrete measures to ensure the adequate development and protection of certain racial groups or individuals belonging to them, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\u201d Annex to G. A. Res. 2106, 20 U. N. GAOR Res. Supp. (No. 14) 47, U. N. Doc. A/6014, Art. 2(2) (1965). But such measures, the Convention instructs, \\u201cshall in no case entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate rights for different racial groups after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved.\\u201d Ibid; see also Art. 1(4) (similarly providing for temporally limited affirmative action); Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Annex to G.

Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978)] first approved the use of race to further an interest in student body diversity in the context of public higher education.\\u201d Ante, at 31. For at least part of that time, however, the law could not fairly be described as \\u201csettled,\\u201d and in some regions of the Nation, overtly race-conscious admissions policies have been proscribed. See Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F. 3d 932 (CA5 1996); cf. Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F. 3d 790 (CA1 1998); Tuttle v. Arlington Cty. School Bd., 195 F. 3d 698 (CA4 1999); Johnson v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Ga., 263 F. 3d 1234 (CA11 2001). Moreover, it was only 25 years before Bakke that this Court declared public school segregation unconstitutional, a declaration that, after prolonged resistance, yielded an end to a law-enforced racial caste system, itself the legacy of centuries of slavery. See Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954); cf. Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1 (1958).\\nIt is well documented that conscious and unconscious race bias, even rank discrimination based on race, remain alive in our land, impeding realization of our highest values and ideals. See, e.g., Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, at 1-4 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 272-274 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Krieger, Civil Rights Perestroika: Intergroup Relations after Affirmative Action, 86 Calif. L. Rev. 1251, 1276-1291, 1303 (1998). As to public education, data for the years 2000-2001 show that 71.6% of African-American children and 76.3% of Hispanic children attended a school in which minorities made up a majority of the student body. See E. Frankenberg, C. Lee, & G. Orfield, A Multiracial Society with Segregated Schools: Are We Losing the Dream? p. 4 (Jan. 2003), http://www.civilrightsproject.\\nharvard.edu / research / reseg03/AreWeLosingtheDream.pdf (as visited June 16, 2003, and available in Clerk of Court\\u2019s case file). And schools in predominantly minority communities lag far behind others measured by the educational resources available to them. See id., at 11; Brief for National Urban League et al. as Amici Curiae 11-12 (citing General Accounting Office, Per-Pupil Spending Differences Between Selected Inner City and Suburban Schools Varied by Metropolitan Area, 17 (2002)).\\nHowever strong the public\\u2019s desire for improved education systems may be, see P. Hart & R. Teeter, A National Priority: Americans Speak on Teacher Quality 2, 11 (2002) (public opinion research conducted for Educational Testing Service); The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Pub. L. 107-110, 115 Stat. 1425 , 20 U. S. C. A. \\u00a77231 (2003 Supp. Pamphlet), it remains the current reality that many minority students encounter markedly inadequate and unequal educational opportunities. Despite these inequalities, some minority students are able to meet the high threshold requirements set for admission to the country\\u2019s finest undergraduate and graduate educational institutions. As lower school education in minority communities improves, an increase in the number of such students may be anticipated. From today\\u2019s vantage point, one may hope, but not firmly forecast, that over the next generation\\u2019s span, progress toward nondiscrimination and genuinely equal opportunity will make it safe to sunset affirmative action.**\\n\\nBARBARA GRUTTER, PETITIONER v.

They contend that a \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d of underrepresented minorities is necessary to further that interest. Ante, at 17. Respondents and school administrators explain generally that \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d means a sufficient number of underrepresented minority students to achieve several objectives: To ensure that these minority students do not feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race; to provide adequate opportunities for the type of interaction upon which the educational benefits of diversity depend; and to challenge all students to think critically and reexamine stereotypes. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 211a; Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 26. These objectives indicate that \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d relates to the size of the student body. Id., at 5 (claiming that the Law School has enrolled \\u201ccritical mass,\\u201d or \\u201cenough minority students to provide meaningful integration of its classrooms and residence halls\\u201d). Respondents further claim that the Law School is achieving \\u201ccritical mass.\\u201d Id., at 4 (noting that the Law School\\u2019s goals have been \\u201cgreatly furthered by the presence of \\u2026 a \\u2018critical mass\\u2019 of \\u201d minority students in the student body).\\nIn practice, the Law School\\u2019s program bears little or no relation to its asserted goal of achieving \\u201ccritical mass.\\u201d Respondents explain that the Law School seeks to accumulate a \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d of each underrepresented minority group. See, e.g., id., at 49, n. 79 (\\u201cThe Law School\\u2019s \\u2026 current policy \\u2026 provide[s] a special commitment to enrolling a \\u2018critical mass\\u2019 of \\u2018Hispanics\\u2019 \\u201c). But the record demonstrates that the Law School\\u2019s admissions practices with respect to these groups differ dramatically and cannot be defended under any consistent use of the term \\u201ccritical mass.\\u201d\\nFrom 1995 through 2000, the Law School admitted between 1,130 and 1,310 students. Of those, between 13 and 19 were Native American, between 91 and 108 were African-Americans, and between 47 and 56 were Hispanic. If the Law School is admitting between 91 and 108\\nAfrican-Americans in order to achieve \\u201ccritical mass,\\u201d thereby preventing African-American students from feeling \\u201cisolated or like spokespersons for their race,\\u201d one would think that a number of the same order of magnitude would be necessary to accomplish the same purpose for Hispanics and Native Americans. Similarly, even if all of the Native American applicants admitted in a given year matriculate, which the record demonstrates is not at all the case,* how can this possibly constitute a \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d of Native Americans in a class of over 350 students? In order for this pattern of admission to be consistent with the Law School\\u2019s explanation of \\u201ccritical mass,\\u201d one would have to believe that the objectives of \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d offered by respondents are achieved with only half the number of Hispanics and one-sixth the number of Native Americans as compared to African-Americans. But respondents offer no race-specific reasons for such disparities. Instead, they simply emphasize the importance of achieving \\u201ccritical mass,\\u201d without any explanation of why that concept is applied differently among the three underrepresented minority groups.\\nThese different numbers, moreover, come only as a result of substantially different treatment among the three underrepresented minority groups, as is apparent in an example offered by the Law School and highlighted by the Court: The school asserts that it \\u201cfrequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected.\\u201d Ante, at 26 (citing Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 10). Specifically, the Law School states that \\u201c[s]ixty-nine minority applicants were rejected between 1995 and 2000 with at least a 3.5 [Grade Point Average (GPA)] and a [score of] 159 or higher on the [Law School Admissions Test (LSAT)]\\u201d while a number of Caucasian and Asian-American applicants with similar or lower scores were admitted. Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 10.\\nReview of the record reveals only 67 such individuals. Of these 67 individuals, 56 were Hispanic, while only 6 were African-American, and only 5 were Native American. This discrepancy reflects a consistent practice. For example, in 2000, 12 Hispanics who scored between a 159-160 on the LSAT and earned a GPA of 3.00 or higher applied for admission and only 2 were admitted. App. 200-201. Meanwhile, 12 African-Americans in the same range of qualifications applied for admission and all 12 were admitted. Id., at 198. Likewise, that same year, 16 Hispanics who scored between a 151-153 on the LSAT and earned a 3.00 or higher applied for admission and only 1 of those applicants was admitted. Id., at 200-201. Twenty-three similarly qualified African-Americans applied for admission and 14 were admitted. Id., at 198.\\nThese statistics have a significant bearing on petitioner\\u2019s case. Respondents have never offered any race-specific arguments explaining why significantly more individuals from one underrepresented minority group are needed in order to achieve \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d or further student body diversity. They certainly have not explained why Hispanics, who they have said are among \\u201cthe groups most isolated by racial barriers in our country,\\u201d should have their admission capped out in this manner. Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 50. True, petitioner is neither Hispanic nor Native American. But the Law School\\u2019s disparate admissions practices with respect to these minority groups demonstrate that its alleged goal of \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d is simply a sham. Petitioner may use these statistics to expose this sham, which is the basis for the Law School\\u2019s admission of less qualified underrepresented minorities in preference to her. Surely strict scrutiny cannot permit these sort of disparities without at least some explanation.\\nOnly when the \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d label is discarded does a likely explanation for these numbers emerge. The Court states that the Law School\\u2019s goal of attaining a \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d of underrepresented minority students is not an interest in merely \\u201d \\u2018assur[ing] within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin.\\u2019 \\u201d Ante, at 17 (quoting Bakke, 438 U. S., at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.)). The Court recognizes that such an interest \\u201cwould amount to outright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional.\\u201d Ante, at 17. The Court concludes, however, that the Law School\\u2019s use of race in admissions, consistent with Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion in Bakke, only pays \\u201d \\u2018[s]ome attention to numbers.\\u2019 \\u201d Ante, at 23 (quoting Bakke, supra, at 323).\\nBut the correlation between the percentage of the Law School\\u2019s pool of applicants who are members of the three minority groups and the percentage of the admitted applicants who are members of these same groups is far too precise to be dismissed as merely the result of the school paying \\u201csome attention to [the] numbers.\\u201d As the tables below show, from 1995 through 2000 the percentage of admitted applicants who were members of these minority groups closely tracked the percentage of individuals in the school\\u2019s applicant pool who were from the same groups.\\nTable 1\\nYear\\nNumber of law school applicants\\nNumber of African- American applicants\\n% of\\napplicants who were African-American\\nNumber of applicants admitted by the law school\\nNumber of African-American applicants admitted\\n% of admitted applicants who were African- American\\n1995\\n4147\\n404\\n9.7%\\n1130\\n106\\n9.4%\\n1996\\n3677\\n342\\n9.3%\\n1170\\n108\\n9.2%\\n1997\\n3429\\n320\\n9.3%\\n1218\\n101\\n8.3%\\n1998\\n3537\\n304\\n8.6%\\n1310\\n103\\n7.9%\\n1999\\n3400\\n247\\n7.3%\\n1280\\n91\\n7.1%\\n2000\\n3432\\n259\\n7.5%\\n1249\\n91\\n7.3%\\nTable 2\\nYear\\nNumber of law school applicants\\nNumber of Hispanic applicants\\n% of\\napplicants who were Hispanic\\nNumber of applicants admitted by the law school\\nNumber of Hispanic applicants admitted\\n% of admitted applicants who were Hispanic\\n1995\\n4147\\n213\\n5.1%\\n1130\\n56\\n5.0%\\n1996\\n3677\\n186\\n5.1%\\n1170\\n54\\n4.6%\\n1997\\n3429\\n163\\n4.8%\\n1218\\n47\\n3.9%\\n1998\\n3537\\n150\\n4.2%\\n1310\\n55\\n4.2%\\n1999\\n3400\\n152\\n4.5%\\n1280\\n48\\n3.8%\\n2000\\n3432\\n168\\n4.9%\\n1249\\n53\\n4.2%\\nTable 3\\nYear\\nNumber of law school applicants\\nNumber of Native American applicants\\n% of\\napplicants who were Native American\\nNumber of applicants admitted by the law school\\nNumber of Native American applicants admitted\\n% of admitted applicants who were Native American\\n1995\\n4147\\n45\\n1.1%\\n1130\\n14\\n1.2%\\n1996\\n3677\\n31\\n0.8%\\n1170\\n13\\n1.1%\\n1997\\n3429\\n37\\n1.1%\\n1218\\n19\\n1.6%\\n1998\\n3537\\n40\\n1.1%\\n1310\\n18\\n1.4%\\n1999\\n3400\\n25\\n0.7%\\n1280\\n13\\n1.0%\\n2000\\n3432\\n35\\n1.0%\\n1249\\n14\\n1.1%\\nFor example, in 1995, when 9.7% of the applicant pool was African-American, 9.4% of the admitted class was African-American. By 2000, only 7.5% of the applicant pool was African-American, and 7.3% of the admitted class was African-American. This correlation is striking. Respondents themselves emphasize that the number of underrepresented minority students admitted to the Law School would be significantly smaller if the race of each applicant were not considered. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a; Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 6 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. of Bollinger et al. 299a). But, as the examples above illustrate, the measure of the decrease would differ dramatically among the groups. The tight correlation between the percentage of applicants and admittees of a given race, therefore, must result from careful race based planning by the Law School. It suggests a formula for admission based on the aspirational assumption that all applicants are equally qualified academically, and therefore that the proportion of each group admitted should be the same as the proportion of that group in the applicant pool. See Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 43, n. 70 (discussing admissions officers\\u2019 use of \\u201cperiodic reports\\u201d to track \\u201cthe racial composition of the developing class\\u201d).\\nNot only do respondents fail to explain this phenomenon, they attempt to obscure it. See id., at 32, n. 50 (\\u201cThe Law School\\u2019s minority enrollment percentages \\u2026 diverged from the percentages in the applicant pool by as much as 17.7% from 1995-2000\\u201d). But the divergence between the percentages of underrepresented minorities in the applicant pool and in the enrolled classes is not the only relevant comparison. In fact, it may not be the most relevant comparison. The Law School cannot precisely control which of its admitted applicants decide to attend the university. But it can and, as the numbers demonstrate, clearly does employ racial preferences in extending offers of admission. Indeed, the ostensibly flexible nature of the Law School\\u2019s admissions program that the Court finds appealing, see ante, at 24-26, appears to be, in practice, a carefully managed program designed to ensure proportionate representation of applicants from selected minority groups.\\nI do not believe that the Constitution gives the Law School such free rein in the use of race. The Law School has offered no explanation for its actual admissions practices and, unexplained, we are bound to conclude that the Law School has managed its admissions program, not to achieve a \\u201ccritical mass,\\u201d but to extend offers of admission to members of selected minority groups in proportion to their statistical representation in the applicant pool. But this is precisely the type of racial balancing that the Court itself calls \\u201cpatently unconstitutional.\\u201d Ante, at 17.\\nFinally, I believe that the Law School\\u2019s program fails strict scrutiny because it is devoid of any reasonably precise time limit on the Law School\\u2019s use of race in admissions. We have emphasized that we will consider \\u201cthe planned duration of the remedy\\u201d in determining whether a race-conscious program is constitutional. Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 510 (Powell, J. concurring); see also United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S. 149, 171 (1987) (\\u201cIn determining whether race-conscious remedies are appropriate, we look to several factors, including the \\u2026 duration of the relief \\u201c). Our previous cases have required some limit on the duration of programs such as this because discrimination on the basis of race is invidious.\\nThe Court suggests a possible 25-year limitation on the Law School\\u2019s current program. See ante, at 30. Respondents, on the other hand, remain more ambiguous, explaining that \\u201cthe Law School of course recognizes that race-conscious programs must have reasonable durational limits, and the Sixth Circuit properly found such a limit in the Law School\\u2019s resolve to cease considering race when genuine race-neutral alternatives become available.\\u201d Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 32. These discussions of a time limit are the vaguest of assurances. In truth, they permit the Law School\\u2019s use of racial preferences on a seemingly permanent basis. Thus, an important component of strict scrutiny\\u2013that a program be limited in time\\u2013is casually subverted.\\nThe Court, in an unprecedented display of deference under our strict scrutiny analysis, upholds the Law School\\u2019s program despite its obvious flaws. We have said that when it comes to the use of race, the connection between the ends and the means used to attain them must be precise. But here the flaw is deeper than that; it is not merely a question of \\u201cfit\\u201d between ends and means. Here the means actually used are forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.\\n\\nBARBARA GRUTTER, PETITIONER v. LEE\\nBOLLINGER et al.\\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of\\nappeals for the sixth circuit\\n[June 23, 2003]\\n\\nJustice Kennedy, dissenting.\\nThe separate opinion by Justice Powell in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke is based on the principle that a university admissions program may take account of race as one, nonpredominant factor in a system designed to consider each applicant as an individual, provided the program can meet the test of strict scrutiny by the judiciary. 438 U. S. 265, 289-291, 315-318 (1978). This is a unitary formulation. If strict scrutiny is abandoned or manipulated to distort its real and accepted meaning, the Court lacks authority to approve the use of race even in this modest, limited way. The opinion by Justice Powell, in my view, states the correct rule for resolving this case. The Court, however, does not apply strict scrutiny. By trying to say otherwise, it undermines both the test and its own controlling precedents.\\nJustice Powell\\u2019s approval of the use of race in university admissions reflected a tradition, grounded in the First Amendment, of acknowledging a university\\u2019s conception of its educational mission. Bakke, supra, at 312-314; ante, at 16-17. Our precedents provide a basis for the Court\\u2019s acceptance of a university\\u2019s considered judgment that racial diversity among students can further its educational task, when supported by empirical evidence. Ante, at 17-19.\\nIt is unfortunate, however, that the Court takes the first part of Justice Powell\\u2019s rule but abandons the second. Having approved the use of race as a factor in the admissions process, the majority proceeds to nullify the essential safeguard Justice Powell insisted upon as the precondition of the approval. The safeguard was rigorous judicial review, with strict scrutiny as the controlling standard. Bakke, supra, at 291 (\\u201cRacial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination\\u201d). This Court has reaffirmed, subsequent to Bakke, the absolute necessity of strict scrutiny when the state uses race as an operative category. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 224 (1995) (\\u201c[A]ny person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny\\u201d); Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493-494 (1989); see id., at 519 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\\u201c[A]ny racial preference must face the most rigorous scrutiny by the courts\\u201d). The Court confuses deference to a university\\u2019s definition of its educational objective with deference to the implementation of this goal. In the context of university admissions the objective of racial diversity can be accepted based on empirical data known to us, but deference is not to be given with respect to the methods by which it is pursued. Preferment by race, when resorted to by the State, can be the most divisive of all policies, containing within it the potential to destroy confidence in the Constitution and in the idea of equality. The majority today refuses to be faithful to the settled principle of strict review designed to reflect these concerns.\\nThe Court, in a review that is nothing short of perfunctory, accepts the University of Michigan Law School\\u2019s assurances that its admissions process meets with constitutional requirements. The majority fails to confront the reality of how the Law School\\u2019s admissions policy is implemented. The dissenting opinion by The Chief Justice, which I join in full, demonstrates beyond question why the concept of critical mass is a delusion used by the Law School to mask its attempt to make race an automatic factor in most instances and to achieve numerical goals indistinguishable from quotas. An effort to achieve racial balance among the minorities the school seeks to attract is, by the Court\\u2019s own admission, \\u201cpatently unconstitutional.\\u201d Ante, at 17; see also Bakke, 438 U. S, at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.). It remains to point out how critical mass becomes inconsistent with individual consideration in some more specific aspects of the admissions process.\\nAbout 80 to 85 percent of the places in the entering class are given to applicants in the upper range of Law School Admissions Test scores and grades. An applicant with these credentials likely will be admitted without consideration of race or ethnicity. With respect to the remaining 15 to 20 percent of the seats, race is likely outcome determinative for many members of minority groups. That is where the competition becomes tight and where any given applicant\\u2019s chance of admission is far smaller if he or she lacks minority status. At this point the numerical concept of critical mass has the real potential to compromise individual review.\\nThe Law School has not demonstrated how individual consideration is, or can be, preserved at this stage of the application process given the instruction to attain what it calls critical mass. In fact the evidence shows otherwise. There was little deviation among admitted minority students during the years from 1995 to 1998. The percentage of enrolled minorities fluctuated only by 0.3%, from 13.5% to 13.8%. The number of minority students to whom offers were extended varied by just a slightly greater magnitude of 2.2%, from the high of 15.6% in 1995 to the low of 13.4% in 1998.\\nThe District Court relied on this uncontested fact to draw an inference that the Law School\\u2019s pursuit of critical mass mutated into the equivalent of a quota. 137 F. Supp. 2d 821, 851 (ED Mich. 2001). Admittedly, there were greater fluctuations among enrolled minorities in the preceding years, 1987-1994, by as much as 5 or 6%. The percentage of minority offers, however, at no point fell below 12%, historically defined by the Law School as the bottom of its critical mass range. The greater variance during the earlier years, in any event, does not dispel suspicion that the school engaged in racial balancing. The data would be consistent with an inference that the Law School modified its target only twice, in 1991 (from 13% to 19%), and then again in 1995 (back from 20% to 13%). The intervening year, 1993, when the percentage dropped to 14.5%, could be an aberration, caused by the school\\u2019s miscalculation as to how many applicants with offers would accept or by its redefinition, made in April 1992, of which minority groups were entitled to race-based preference. See Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 49, n. 79.\\nYear\\nPercentage of enrolled minority students\\n1987\\n12.3%\\n1988\\n13.6%\\n1989\\n14.4%\\n1990\\n13.4%\\n1991\\n19.1%\\n1992\\n19.8%\\n1993\\n14.5%\\n1994\\n20.1%\\n1995\\n13.5%\\n1996\\n13.8%\\n1997\\n13.6%\\n1998\\n13.8%\\nThe narrow fluctuation band raises an inference that the Law School subverted individual determination, and strict scrutiny requires the Law School to overcome the inference. Whether the objective of critical mass \\u201cis described as a quota or a goal, it is a line drawn on the basis of race and ethnic status,\\u201d and so risks compromising individual assessment. Bakke, 438 U. S., at 289 (opinion of Powell, J.). In this respect the Law School program compares unfavorably with the experience of Little Ivy League colleges. Amicus Amherst College, for example, informs us that the offers it extended to students of African-American background during the period from 1993 to 2002 ranged between 81 and 125 out of 950 offers total, resulting in a fluctuation from 24 to 49 matriculated students in a class of about 425. See Brief for Amherst College et al. as Amici Curiae 10-11. The Law School insisted upon a much smaller fluctuation, both in the offers extended and in the students who eventually enrolled, despite having a comparable class size.\\nThe Law School has the burden of proving, in conformance with the standard of strict scrutiny, that it did not utilize race in an unconstitutional way. Adarand Constructors, 515 U. S., at 224. At the very least, the constancy of admitted minority students and the close correlation between the racial breakdown of admitted minorities and the composition of the applicant pool, discussed by The Chief Justice, ante, at 3-9, require the Law School either to produce a convincing explanation or to show it has taken adequate steps to ensure individual assessment. The Law School does neither.\\nThe obvious tension between the pursuit of critical mass and the requirement of individual review increased by the end of the admissions season. Most of the decisions where race may decide the outcome are made during this period. See supra, at 3. The admissions officers consulted the daily reports which indicated the composition of the incoming class along racial lines. As Dennis Shields, Director of Admissions from 1991 to 1996, stated, \\u201cthe further [he] went into the [admissions] season the more frequently [he] would want to look at these [reports] and see the change from day-to-day.\\u201d These reports would \\u201ctrack exactly where [the Law School] st[ood] at any given time in assembling the class,\\u201d and so would tell the admissions personnel whether they were short of assembling a critical mass of minority students. Shields generated these reports because the Law School\\u2019s admissions policy told him the racial make-up of the entering class was \\u201csomething [he] need[ed] to be concerned about,\\u201d and so he had \\u201cto find a way of tracking what\\u2019s going on.\\u201d\\nThe consultation of daily reports during the last stages in the admissions process suggests there was no further attempt at individual review save for race itself. The admissions officers could use the reports to recalibrate the plus factor given to race depending on how close they were to achieving the Law School\\u2019s goal of critical mass. The bonus factor of race would then become divorced from individual review; it would be premised instead on the numerical objective set by the Law School.\\nThe Law School made no effort to guard against this danger. It provided no guidelines to its admissions personnel on how to reconcile individual assessment with the directive to admit a critical mass of minority students. The admissions program could have been structured to eliminate at least some of the risk that the promise of individual evaluation was not being kept. The daily consideration of racial breakdown of admitted students is not a feature of affirmative-action programs used by other institutions of higher learning. The Little Ivy League colleges, for instance, do not keep ongoing tallies of racial or ethnic composition of their entering students. See Brief for Amherst College et al. as Amici Curiae 10.\\nTo be constitutional, a university\\u2019s compelling interest in a diverse student body must be achieved by a system where individual assessment is safeguarded through the entire process. There is no constitutional objection to the goal of considering race as one modest factor among many others to achieve diversity, but an educational institution must ensure, through sufficient procedures, that each applicant receives individual consideration and that race does not become a predominant factor in the admissions decisionmaking. The Law School failed to comply with this requirement, and by no means has it carried its burden to show otherwise by the test of strict scrutiny.\\nThe Court\\u2019s refusal to apply meaningful strict scrutiny will lead to serious consequences. By deferring to the law schools\\u2019 choice of minority admissions programs, the courts will lose the talents and resources of the faculties and administrators in devising new and fairer ways to ensure individual consideration. Constant and rigorous judicial review forces the law school faculties to undertake their responsibilities as state employees in this most sensitive of areas with utmost fidelity to the mandate of the Constitution. Dean Allan Stillwagon, who directed the Law School\\u2019s Office of Admissions from 1979 to 1990, explained the difficulties he encountered in defining racial groups entitled to benefit under the School\\u2019s affirmative action policy. He testified that faculty members were \\u201cbreathtakingly cynical\\u201d in deciding who would qualify as a member of underrepresented minorities. An example he offered was faculty debate as to whether Cubans should be counted as Hispanics: One professor objected on the grounds that Cubans were Republicans. Many academics at other law schools who are \\u201caffirmative action\\u2019s more forthright defenders readily concede that diversity is merely the current rationale of convenience for a policy that they prefer to justify on other grounds.\\u201d Schuck, Affirmative Action: Past, Present, and Future, 20 Yale L. & Pol\\u2019y Rev. 1, 34 (2002) (citing Levinson, Diversity, 2 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 573, 577-578 (2000); Rubenfeld, Affirmative Action, 107 Yale L. J. 427, 471 (1997)). This is not to suggest the faculty at Michigan or other law schools do not pursue aspirations they consider laudable and consistent with our constitutional traditions. It is but further evidence of the necessity for scrutiny that is real, not feigned, where the corrosive category of race is a factor in decisionmaking. Prospective students, the courts, and the public can demand that the State and its law schools prove their process is fair and constitutional in every phase of implementation.\\nIt is difficult to assess the Court\\u2019s pronouncement that race-conscious admissions programs will be unnecessary 25 years from now. Ante, at 30-31. If it is intended to mitigate the damage the Court does to the concept of strict scrutiny, neither petitioners nor other rejected law school applicants will find solace in knowing the basic protection put in place by Justice Powell will be suspended for a full quarter of a century. Deference is antithetical to strict scrutiny, not consistent with it.\\nAs to the interpretation that the opinion contains its own self-destruct mechanism, the majority\\u2019s abandonment of strict scrutiny undermines this objective. Were the courts to apply a searching standard to race-based admissions schemes, that would force educational institutions to seriously explore race-neutral alternatives. The Court, by contrast, is willing to be satisfied by the Law School\\u2019s profession of its own good faith. The majority admits as much: \\u201cWe take the Law School at its word that it would \\u2018like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula\\u2019 and will terminate its race-conscious admissions program as soon as practicable.\\u201d Ante, at 30 (quoting Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 34).\\nIf universities are given the latitude to administer programs that are tantamount to quotas, they will have few incentives to make the existing minority admissions schemes transparent and protective of individual review. The unhappy consequence will be to perpetuate the hostilities that proper consideration of race is designed to avoid. The perpetuation, of course, would be the worst of all outcomes. Other programs do exist which will be more effective in bringing about the harmony and mutual respect among all citizens that our constitutional tradition has always sought. They, and not the program under review here, should be the model, even if the Court defaults by not demanding it.\\nIt is regrettable the Court\\u2019s important holding allowing racial minorities to have their special circumstances considered in order to improve their educational opportunities is accompanied by a suspension of the strict scrutiny which was the predicate of allowing race to be considered in the first place. If the Court abdicates its constitutional duty to give strict scrutiny to the use of race in university admissions, it negates my authority to approve the use of race in pursuit of student diversity. The Constitution cannot confer the right to classify on the basis of race even in this special context absent searching judicial review. For these reasons, though I reiterate my approval of giving appropriate consideration to race in this one context, I must dissent in the present case.\\n\\nBARBARA GRUTTER, PETITIONER v. LEE\\nBOLLINGER et al.\\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of\\nappeals for the sixth circuit\\n[June 23, 2003]\\n\\nJustice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\\nI join the opinion of The Chief Justice. As he demonstrates, the University of Michigan Law School\\u2019s mystical \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d justification for its discrimination by race challenges even the most gullible mind. The admissions statistics show it to be a sham to cover a scheme of racially proportionate admissions.\\nI also join Parts I through VII of Justice Thomas\\u2019s opinion.* I find particularly unanswerable his central point: that the allegedly \\u201ccompelling state interest\\u201d at issue here is not the incremental \\u201ceducational benefit\\u201d that emanates from the fabled \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d of minority students, but rather Michigan\\u2019s interest in maintaining a \\u201cprestige\\u201d law school whose normal admissions standards disproportionately exclude blacks and other minorities. If that is a compelling state interest, everything is.\\nI add the following: The \\u201ceducational benefit\\u201d that the University of Michigan seeks to achieve by racial discrimination consists, according to the Court, of \\u201d \\u2018cross-racial understanding,\\u2019 \\u201d ante, at 18, and \\u201d \\u2018better prepar[ation of] students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society,\\u2019 \\u201d ibid., all of which is necessary not only for work, but also for good \\u201ccitizenship,\\u201d ante, at 19. This is not, of course, an \\u201ceducational benefit\\u201d on which students will be graded on their Law School transcript (Works and Plays Well with Others: B+) or tested by the bar examiners (Q: Describe in 500 words or less your cross-racial understanding). For it is a lesson of life rather than law\\u2013essentially the same lesson taught to (or rather learned by, for it cannot be \\u201ctaught\\u201d in the usual sense) people three feet shorter and twenty years younger than the full-grown adults at the University of Michigan Law School, in institutions ranging from Boy Scout troops to public-school kindergartens. If properly considered an \\u201ceducational benefit\\u201d at all, it is surely not one that is either uniquely relevant to law school or uniquely \\u201cteachable\\u201d in a formal educational setting. And therefore: If it is appropriate for the University of Michigan Law School to use racial discrimination for the purpose of putting together a \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d that will convey generic lessons in socialization and good citizenship, surely it is no less appropriate\\u2013indeed, particularly appropriate\\u2013for the civil service system of the State of Michigan to do so. There, also, those exposed to \\u201ccritical masses\\u201d of certain races will presumably become better Americans, better Michiganders, better civil servants. And surely private employers cannot be criticized\\u2013indeed, should be praised\\u2013if they also \\u201cteach\\u201d good citizenship to their adult employees through a patriotic, all-American system of racial discrimination in hiring. The nonminority individuals who are deprived of a legal education, a civil service job, or any job at all by reason of their skin color will surely understand.\\nUnlike a clear constitutional holding that racial preferences in state educational institutions are impermissible, or even a clear anticonstitutional holding that racial preferences in state educational institutions are OK, today\\u2019s Grutter-Gratz split double header seems perversely designed to prolong the controversy and the litigation. Some future lawsuits will presumably focus on whether the discriminatory scheme in question contains enough evaluation of the applicant \\u201cas an individual,\\u201d ante, at 24, and sufficiently avoids \\u201cseparate admissions tracks\\u201d ante, at 22, to fall under Grutter rather than Gratz. Some will focus on whether a university has gone beyond the bounds of a \\u201d \\u2018good faith effort\\u2019 \\u201d and has so zealously pursued its \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d as to make it an unconstitutional de facto quota system, rather than merely \\u201d \\u2018a permissible goal.\\u2019 \\u201d Ante, at 23 (quoting Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S 421, 495 (1986) (O\\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). Other lawsuits may focus on whether, in the particular setting at issue, any educational benefits flow from racial diversity. (That issue was not contested in Grutter; and while the opinion accords \\u201ca degree of deference to a university\\u2019s academic decisions,\\u201d ante, at 16, \\u201cdeference does not imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review,\\u201d Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 340 (2003).) Still other suits may challenge the bona fides of the institution\\u2019s expressed commitment to the educational benefits of diversity that immunize the discriminatory scheme in Grutter. (Tempting targets, one would suppose, will be those universities that talk the talk of multiculturalism and racial diversity in the courts but walk the walk of tribalism and racial segregation on their campuses\\u2013through minority-only student organizations, separate minority housing opportunities, separate minority student centers, even separate minority-only graduation ceremonies.) And still other suits may claim that the institution\\u2019s racial preferences have gone below or above the mystical Grutter-approved \\u201ccritical mass.\\u201d Finally, litigation can be expected on behalf of minority groups intentionally short changed in the institution\\u2019s composition of its generic minority \\u201ccritical mass.\\u201d I do not look forward to any of these cases. The Constitution proscribes government discrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided education is no exception.\\n\\nBARBARA GRUTTER, PETITIONER v.

I have had but one answer from the beginning. Do nothing with us! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us. Do nothing with us!

Let him alone! \\u2026 [Y]our interference is doing him positive injury.\\u201d What the Black Man Wants: An Address Delivered in Boston, Massachusetts, on 26 January 1865, reprinted in 4 The Frederick Douglass Papers 59, 68 (J. Blassingame & J. McKivigan eds. 1991) (emphasis in original).\\nLike Douglass, I believe blacks can achieve in every avenue of American life without the meddling of university administrators. Because I wish to see all students succeed whatever their color, I share, in some respect, the sympathies of those who sponsor the type of discrimination advanced by the University of Michigan Law School (Law School). The Constitution does not, however, tolerate institutional devotion to the status quo in admissions policies when such devotion ripens into racial discrimination. Nor does the Constitution countenance the unprecedented deference the Court gives to the Law School, an approach inconsistent with the very concept of \\u201cstrict scrutiny.\\u201d\\nNo one would argue that a university could set up a lower general admission standard and then impose heightened requirements only on black applicants. Similarly, a university may not maintain a high admission standard and grant exemptions to favored races. The Law School, of its own choosing, and for its own purposes, maintains an exclusionary admissions system that it knows produces racially disproportionate results. Racial discrimination is not a permissible solution to the self-inflicted wounds of this elitist admissions policy.\\nThe majority upholds the Law School\\u2019s racial discrimination not by interpreting the people\\u2019s Constitution, but by responding to a faddish slogan of the cognoscenti. Nevertheless, I concur in part in the Court\\u2019s opinion. First, I agree with the Court insofar as its decision, which approves of only one racial classification, confirms that further use of race in admissions remains unlawful. Second, I agree with the Court\\u2019s holding that racial discrimination in higher education admissions will be illegal in 25 years. See ante, at 31 (stating that racial discrimination will no longer be narrowly tailored, or \\u201cnecessary to further\\u201d a compelling state interest, in 25 years). I respectfully dissent from the remainder of the Court\\u2019s opinion and the judgment, however, because I believe that the Law School\\u2019s current use of race violates the Equal Protection Clause and that the Constitution means the same thing today as it will in 300 months.\\nI\\nThe majority agrees that the Law School\\u2019s racial discrimination should be subjected to strict scrutiny. Ante,\\nat 14. Before applying that standard to this case, I\\nwill briefly revisit the Court\\u2019s treatment of racial\\nclassifications.\\nThe strict scrutiny standard that the Court purports to apply in this case was first enunciated in Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944). There the Court held that \\u201c[p]ressing public necessity may sometimes justify the existence of [racial discrimination]; racial antagonism never can.\\u201d Id., at 216. This standard of \\u201cpressing public necessity\\u201d has more frequently been termed \\u201ccompelling governmental interest,\\u201d1 see, e.g., Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 299 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). A majority of the Court has validated only two circumstances where \\u201cpressing public necessity\\u201d or a \\u201ccompelling state interest\\u201d can possibly justify racial discrimination by state actors. First, the lesson of Korematsu is that national security constitutes a \\u201cpressing public necessity,\\u201d though the government\\u2019s use of race to advance that objective must be narrowly tailored. Second, the Court has recognized as a compelling state interest a government\\u2019s effort to remedy past discrimination for which it is responsible. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 504 (1989).\\nThe contours of \\u201cpressing public necessity\\u201d can be further discerned from those interests the Court has rejected as bases for racial discrimination. For example, Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), found unconstitutional a collective-bargaining agreement between a school board and a teachers\\u2019 union that favored certain minority races. The school board defended the policy on the grounds that minority teachers provided \\u201crole models\\u201d for minority students and that a racially \\u201cdiverse\\u201d faculty would improve the education of all students. See Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1984, No. 84-1340, pp. 27-28; 476 U. S., at 315 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\\u201c[A]n integrated faculty will be able to provide benefits to the student body that could not be provided by an all-white, or nearly all-white faculty\\u201d). Nevertheless, the Court found that the use of race violated the Equal Protection Clause, deeming both asserted state interests insufficiently compelling. Id., at 275-276 (plurality opinion); id., at 295 (White, J., concurring in judgment) (\\u201cNone of the interests asserted by the [school board] \\u2026 justify this racially discriminatory layoff policy\\u201d).2\\nAn even greater governmental interest involves the sensitive role of courts in child custody determinations. In Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S. 429 (1984), the Court held that even the best interests of a child did not constitute a compelling state interest that would allow a state court to award custody to the father because the mother was in a mixed-race marriage. Id., at 433 (finding the interest \\u201csubstantial\\u201d but holding the custody decision could not be based on the race of the mother\\u2019s new husband).\\nFinally, the Court has rejected an interest in remedying general societal discrimination as a justification for race discrimination. See Wygant, supra, at 276 (plurality opinion); Croson, 488 U. S., at 496-498 (plurality opinion); id., at 520-521 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). \\u201cSocietal discrimination, without more, is too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy\\u201d because a \\u201ccourt could uphold remedies that are ageless in their reach into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the future.\\u201d Wygant, supra, at 276 (plurality opinion). But see Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, p. ___ (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).\\nWhere the Court has accepted only national security, and rejected even the best interests of a child, as a justification for racial discrimination, I conclude that only those measures the State must take to provide a bulwark against anarchy, or to prevent violence, will constitute a \\u201cpressing public necessity.\\u201d Cf. Lee v. Washington, 390 U. S. 333, 334 (1968) (per curiam) (Black, J., concurring) (indicating that protecting prisoners from violence might justify narrowly tailored racial discrimination); Croson, supra, at 521 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\\u201cAt least where state or local action is at issue, only a social emergency rising to the level of imminent danger to life and limb \\u2026 can justify [racial discrimination]\\u201d).\\nThe Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all. \\u201cPurchased at the price of immeasurable human suffering, the equal protection principle reflects our Nation\\u2019s understanding that such classifications ultimately have a destructive impact on the individual and our society.\\u201d Adarand Construction, Inc. v. Pe\\u00f1a,, 515 U. S. 200, 240 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\\nII\\nUnlike the majority, I seek to define with precision the interest being asserted by the Law School before determining whether that interest is so compelling as to justify racial discrimination. The Law School maintains that it wishes to obtain \\u201ceducational benefits that flow from student body diversity,\\u201d Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 14. This statement must be evaluated carefully, because it implies that both \\u201cdiversity\\u201d and \\u201ceducational benefits\\u201d are components of the Law School\\u2019s compelling state interest. Additionally, the Law School\\u2019s refusal to entertain certain changes in its admissions process and status indicates that the compelling state interest it seeks to validate is actually broader than might appear at first glance.\\nUndoubtedly there are other ways to \\u201cbetter\\u201d the education of law students aside from ensuring that the student body contains a \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d of underrepresented minority students. Attaining \\u201cdiversity,\\u201d whatever it means,3 is the mechanism by which the Law School obtains educational benefits, not an end of itself. The Law School, however, apparently believes that only a racially mixed student body can lead to the educational benefits it seeks. How, then, is the Law School\\u2019s interest in these allegedly unique educational \\u201cbenefits\\u201d not simply the forbidden interest in \\u201cracial balancing,\\u201d ante, at 17, that the majority expressly rejects?\\nA distinction between these two ideas (unique educational benefits based on racial aesthetics and race for its own sake) is purely sophistic\\u2013so much so that the majority uses them interchangeably. Compare ante, at 16 (\\u201c[T]he Law School has a compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body\\u201d), with ante, at 21 (referring to the \\u201ccompelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body\\u201d (emphasis added)). The Law School\\u2019s argument, as facile as it is, can only be understood in one way: Classroom aesthetics yields educational benefits, racially discriminatory admissions policies are required to achieve the right racial mix, and therefore the policies are required to achieve the educational benefits. It is the educational benefits that are the end, or allegedly compelling state interest, not \\u201cdiversity.\\u201d But see ante,\\nat 20 (citing the need for \\u201copenness and integrity of\\nthe educational institutions that provide [legal] train-\\ning\\u201d without reference to any consequential educational benefits).\\nOne must also consider the Law School\\u2019s refusal to entertain changes to its current admissions system that might produce the same educational benefits. The Law School adamantly disclaims any race-neutral alternative that would reduce \\u201cacademic selectivity,\\u201d which would in turn \\u201crequire the Law School to become a very different institution, and to sacrifice a core part of its educational mission.\\u201d Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 33-36. In other words, the Law School seeks to improve marginally the education it offers without sacrificing too much of its exclusivity and elite status.4\\nThe proffered interest that the majority vindicates today, then, is not simply \\u201cdiversity.\\u201d Instead the Court upholds the use of racial discrimination as a tool to advance the Law School\\u2019s interest in offering a marginally superior education while maintaining an elite institution. Unless each constituent part of this state interest is of pressing public necessity, the Law School\\u2019s use of race is unconstitutional. I find each of them to fall far short of this standard.\\nIII\\nA\\nA close reading of the Court\\u2019s opinion reveals that all of its legal work is done through one conclusory statement: The Law School has a \\u201ccompelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.\\u201d Ante, at 21. No serious effort is made to explain how these benefits fit with the state interests the Court has recognized (or rejected) as compelling, see Part I, supra, or to place any theoretical constraints on an enterprising court\\u2019s desire to discover still more justifications for racial discrimination. In the absence of any explanation, one might expect the Court to fall back on the judicial policy of stare decisis. But the Court eschews even this weak defense of its holding, shunning an analysis of the extent to which Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978), is binding, ante, at 13, in favor of an unfounded wholesale adoption of it.\\nJustice Powell\\u2019s opinion in Bakke and the Court\\u2019s decision today rest on the fundamentally flawed proposition that racial discrimination can be contextualized so that a goal, such as classroom aesthetics, can be compelling in one context but not in another. This \\u201cwe know it when we see it\\u201d approach to evaluating state interests is not capable of judicial application. Today, the Court insists on radically expanding the range of permissible uses of race to something as trivial (by comparison) as the assembling of a law school class. I can only presume that the majority\\u2019s failure to justify its decision by reference to any principle arises from the absence of any such principle. See Part VI, infra.\\nB\\nUnder the proper standard, there is no pressing public necessity in maintaining a public law school at all and, it follows, certainly not an elite law school. Likewise, marginal improvements in legal education do not qualify as a compelling state interest.\\n1\\nWhile legal education at a public university may be good policy or otherwise laudable, it is obviously not a pressing public necessity when the correct legal standard is applied. Additionally, circumstantial evidence as to whether a state activity is of pressing public necessity can be obtained by asking whether all States feel compelled to engage in that activity. Evidence that States, in general, engage in a certain activity by no means demonstrates that the activity constitutes a pressing public necessity, given the expansive role of government in today\\u2019s society. The fact that some fraction of the States reject a particular enterprise, however, creates a presumption that the enterprise itself is not a compelling state interest. In this sense, the absence of a public, American Bar Association (ABA) accredited, law school in Alaska, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, see ABA-LSAC Official Guide to ABA-Approved Law Schools (W. Margolis, B. Gordon, J. Puskarz, & D. Rosenlieb, eds. 2004) (hereinafter ABA-LSAC Guide), provides further evidence that Michigan\\u2019s maintenance of the Law School does not constitute a compelling state interest.\\n2\\nAs the foregoing makes clear, Michigan has no compelling interest in having a law school at all, much less an elite one. Still, even assuming that a State may, under appropriate circumstances, demonstrate a cognizable interest in having an elite law school, Michigan has failed to do so here.\\nThis Court has limited the scope of equal protection review to interests and activities that occur within that State\\u2019s jurisdiction. The Court held in Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U. S. 337 (1938), that Missouri could not satisfy the demands of \\u201cseparate but equal\\u201d by paying for legal training of blacks at neighboring state law schools, while maintaining a segregated law school within the State. The equal protection\\n\\u201cobligation is imposed by the Constitution upon the States severally as governmental entities\\u2013each responsible for its own laws establishing the rights and duties of persons within its borders. It is an obligation the burden of which cannot be cast by one State upon another, and no State can be excused from performance by what another State may do or fail to do. That separate responsibility of each State within its own sphere is of the essence of statehood maintained under our dual system.\\u201d Id., at 350 (emphasis added).\\nThe Equal Protection Clause, as interpreted by the Court in Gaines, does not permit States to justify racial discrimination on the basis of what the rest of the Nation \\u201cmay do or fail to do.\\u201d The only interests that can satisfy the Equal Protection Clause\\u2019s demands are those found within a State\\u2019s jurisdiction.\\nThe only cognizable state interests vindicated by operating a public law school are, therefore, the education of that State\\u2019s citizens and the training of that State\\u2019s lawyers. James Campbell\\u2019s address at the opening of the Law Department at the University of Michigan on October 3, 1859, makes this clear:\\n\\u201cIt not only concerns the State that every one should have all reasonable facilities for preparing himself for any honest position in life to which he may aspire, but it also concerns the community that the Law should be taught and understood\\u2026 . There is not an office in the State in which serious legal inquiries may not frequently arise\\u2026 . In all these matters, public and private rights are constantly involved and discussed, and ignorance of the Law has frequently led to results deplorable and alarming\\u2026 . [I]n the history of this State, in more than one instance, that ignorance has led to unlawful violence, and the shedding of innocent blood.\\u201d E. Brown, Legal Education at Michigan 1859-1959, pp. 404-406 (1959) (emphasis added).\\nThe Law School today, however, does precious little training of those attorneys who will serve the citizens of Michigan. In 2002, graduates of the University of Michigan Law School made up less than 6% of applicants to the Michigan bar, Michigan Lawyers Weekly, available at http: // www.michiganlawyersweekly.com / barpassers0202.cfm, barpassers0702.cfm (all Internet materials as visited June 13, 2003, and available in Clerk of Court\\u2019s case file), even though the Law School\\u2019s graduates constitute nearly 30% of all law students graduating in Michigan.\\nIbid. Less than 16% of the Law School\\u2019s graduating class elects to stay in Michigan after law school. ABA-LSAC Guide 427. Thus, while a mere 27% of the Law School\\u2019s 2002 entering class are from Michigan, see University of Michigan Law School Website, available at http:// www.law.umich.edu / prospectivestudents /Admissions/index.htm, only half of these, it appears, will stay in Michigan.\\nIn sum, the Law School trains few Michigan residents and overwhelmingly serves students, who, as lawyers, leave the State of Michigan. By contrast, Michigan\\u2019s other public law school, Wayne State University Law School, sends 88% of its graduates on to serve the people of Michigan. ABA-LSAC Guide 775. It does not take a social scientist to conclude that it is precisely the Law School\\u2019s status as an elite institution that causes it to be a way- station for the rest of the country\\u2019s lawyers, rather than a training ground for those who will remain in Michigan. The Law School\\u2019s decision to be an elite institution does little to advance the welfare of the people of Michigan or any cognizable interest of the State of Michigan.\\nAgain, the fact that few States choose to maintain elite law schools raises a strong inference that there is nothing compelling about elite status. Arguably, only the public law schools of the University of Texas, the University of California, Berkeley (Boalt Hall), and the University of Virginia maintain the same reputation for excellence as the Law School.5 Two of these States, Texas and California, are so large that they could reasonably be expected to provide elite legal training at a separate law school to students who will, in fact, stay in the State and provide legal services to its citizens. And these two schools far outshine the Law School in producing in-state lawyers. The University of Texas, for example, sends over three-fourths of its graduates on to work in the State of Texas, vindicating the State\\u2019s interest (compelling or not) in training Texas\\u2019 lawyers. Id., at 691.\\n3\\nFinally, even if the Law School\\u2019s racial tinkering produces tangible educational benefits, a marginal improvement in legal education cannot justify racial discrimination where the Law School has no compelling interest in either its existence or in its current educational and admissions policies.\\nIV\\nThe interest in remaining elite and exclusive that the majority thinks so obviously critical requires the use of admissions \\u201cstandards\\u201d that, in turn, create the Law School\\u2019s \\u201cneed\\u201d to discriminate on the basis of race. The Court validates these admissions standards by concluding that alternatives that would require \\u201ca dramatic sacrifice of \\u2026 the academic quality of all admitted students,\\u201d ante, at 27, need not be considered before racial discrimination can be employed.6 In the majority\\u2019s view, such methods are not required by the \\u201cnarrow tailoring\\u201d prong of strict scrutiny because that inquiry demands, in this context, that any race-neutral alternative work \\u201d \\u2018about as well.\\u2019 \\u201d Ante, at 26-27 (quoting Wygant, 476 U. S., at 280, n. 6). The majority errs, however, because race-neutral alternatives must only be \\u201cworkable,\\u201d ante, at 27, and do \\u201cabout as well\\u201d in vindicating the compelling state interest. The Court never explicitly holds that the Law School\\u2019s desire to retain the status quo in \\u201cacademic selectivity\\u201d is itself a compelling state interest, and, as I have demonstrated, it is not. See Part III-B, supra. Therefore, the Law School should be forced to choose between its classroom aesthetic and its exclusionary admissions system\\u2013it cannot have it both ways.\\nWith the adoption of different admissions methods, such as accepting all students who meet minimum qualifications, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13-14, the Law School could achieve its vision of the racially aesthetic student body without the use of racial discrimination. The Law School concedes this, but the Court holds, implicitly and under the guise of narrow tailoring, that the Law School has a compelling state interest in doing what it wants to do. I cannot agree. First, under strict scrutiny, the Law School\\u2019s assessment of the benefits of racial discrimination and devotion to the admissions status quo are not entitled to any sort of deference, grounded in the First Amendment or anywhere else. Second, even if its \\u201cacademic selectivity\\u201d must be maintained at all costs along with racial discrimination, the Court ignores the fact that other top law schools have succeeded in meeting their aesthetic demands without racial discrimination.\\nA\\nThe Court bases its unprecedented deference to the Law School\\u2013a deference antithetical to strict scrutiny\\u2013on an idea of \\u201ceducational autonomy\\u201d grounded in the First Amendment. Ante, at 17. In my view, there is no basis for a right of public universities to do what would otherwise violate the Equal Protection Clause.\\nThe constitutionalization of \\u201cacademic freedom\\u201d began with the concurring opinion of Justice Frankfurter in Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234 (1957). Sweezy, a Marxist economist, was investigated by the Attorney General of New Hampshire on suspicion of being a subversive. The prosecution sought, inter alia, the contents of a lecture Sweezy had given at the University of New Hampshire. The Court held that the investigation violated due process. Id., at 254.\\nJustice Frankfurter went further, however, reasoning that the First Amendment created a right of academic freedom that prohibited the investigation. Id., at 256-267 (opinion concurring in result). Much of the rhetoric in Justice Frankfurter\\u2019s opinion was devoted to the personal right of Sweezy to free speech. See, e.g., id., at 265 (\\u201cFor a citizen to be made to forgo even a part of so basic a liberty as his political autonomy, the subordinating interest of the State must be compelling\\u201d). Still, claiming that the United States Reports \\u201cneed not be burdened with proof,\\u201d Justice Frankfurter also asserted that a \\u201cfree society\\u201d depends on \\u201cfree universities\\u201d and \\u201c[t]his means the exclusion of governmental intervention in the intellectual life of a university.\\u201d Id., at 262. According to Justice Frankfurter: \\u201c[I]t is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment and creation. It is an atmosphere in which there prevail \\u2018the four essential freedoms\\u2019 of a university\\u2013to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study.\\u2019 \\u201d Id., at 263 (citation omitted).\\nIn my view, \\u201c[i]t is the business\\u201d of this Court to explain itself when it cites provisions of the Constitution to invent new doctrines\\u2013including the idea that the First Amendment authorizes a public university to do what would otherwise violate the Equal Protection Clause. The majority fails in its summary effort to prove this point. The only source for the Court\\u2019s conclusion that public universities are entitled to deference even within the confines of strict scrutiny is Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion in Bakke. Justice Powell, for his part, relied only on Justice Frankfurter\\u2019s opinion in Sweezy and the Court\\u2019s decision in Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967), to support his view that the First Amendment somehow protected a public university\\u2019s use of race in admissions. Bakke, 438 U. S., at 312. Keyishian provides no answer to the question whether the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s restrictions are relaxed when applied to public universities. In that case, the Court held that state statutes and regulations designed to prevent the \\u201cappointment or retention of \\u2018subversive\\u2019 persons in state employment,\\u201d 385 U. S., at 592, violated the First Amendment for vagueness. The statutes covered all public employees and were not invalidated only as applied to university faculty members, although the Court appeared sympathetic to the notion of academic freedom, calling it a \\u201cspecial concern of the First Amendment.\\u201d Id., at 603. Again, however, the Court did not relax any independent constitutional restrictions on public universities.\\nI doubt that when Justice Frankfurter spoke of governmental intrusions into the independence of universities, he was thinking of the Constitution\\u2019s ban on racial discrimination. The majority\\u2019s broad deference to both the Law School\\u2019s judgment that racial aesthetics leads to educational benefits and its stubborn refusal to alter the status quo in admissions methods finds no basis in the Constitution or decisions of this Court.\\nB\\n1\\nThe Court\\u2019s deference to the Law School\\u2019s conclusion that its racial experimentation leads to educational benefits will, if adhered to, have serious collateral consequences. The Court relies heavily on social science evidence to justify its deference. See ante, at 18-20; but see also Rothman, Lipset, & Nevitte, Racial Diversity Reconsidered, 151 Public Interest 25 (2003) (finding that the racial mix of a student body produced by racial discrimination of the type practiced by the Law School in fact hinders students\\u2019 perception of academic quality). The Court never acknowledges, however, the growing evidence that racial (and other sorts) of heterogeneity actually impairs learning among black students. See, e.g., Flowers & Pascarella, Cognitive Effects of College Racial Composition on African American Students After 3 Years of College, 40 J. of College Student Development 669, 674 (1999) (concluding that black students experience superior cognitive development at Historically Black Colleges (HBCs) and that, even among blacks, \\u201ca substantial diversity moderates the cognitive effects of attending an HBC\\u201d); Allen, The Color of Success: African-American College Student Outcomes at Predominantly White and Historically Black Public Colleges and Universities, 62 Harv. Educ. Rev. 26, 35 (1992) (finding that black students attending HBCs report higher academic achievement than those attending predominantly white colleges).\\nAt oral argument in Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, p. ___, counsel for respondents stated that \\u201cmost every single one of [the HBCs] do have diverse student bodies.\\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 02-516, p. 52. What precisely counsel meant by \\u201cdiverse\\u201d is indeterminate, but it is reported that in 2000 at Morehouse College, one of the most distinguished HBC\\u2019s in the Nation, only 0.1% of the student body was white, and only 0.2% was Hispanic. College Admissions Data Handbook 2002-2003, p. 613 (43d ed. 2002) (hereinafter College Admissions Data Handbook). And at Mississippi Valley State University, a public HBC, only 1.1% of the freshman class in 2001 was white. Id., at 603. If there is a \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d of whites at these institutions, then \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d is indeed a very small proportion.\\nThe majority grants deference to the Law School\\u2019s \\u201cassessment that diversity will, in fact, yield educational benefits,\\u201d ante, at 16. It follows, therefore, that an HBC\\u2019s assessment that racial homogeneity will yield educational benefits would similarly be given deference.7 An HBC\\u2019s rejection of white applicants in order to maintain racial homogeneity seems permissible, therefore, under the majority\\u2019s view of the Equal Protection Clause. But see United States v. Fordice, 505 U. S. 717, 748 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring) (\\u201cObviously, a State cannot maintain \\u2026 traditions by closing particular institutions, historically white or historically black, to particular racial groups\\u201d). Contained within today\\u2019s majority opinion is the seed of a new constitutional justification for a concept I thought long and rightly rejected\\u2013racial segregation.\\n2\\nMoreover one would think, in light of the Court\\u2019s decision in United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515 (1996), that before being given license to use racial discrimination, the Law School would be required to radically reshape its admissions process, even to the point of sacrificing some elements of its character. In Virginia, a majority of the Court, without a word about academic freedom, accepted the all-male Virginia Military Institute\\u2019s (VMI) representation that some changes in its \\u201cadversative\\u201d method of education would be required with the admission of women, id., at 540, but did not defer to VMI\\u2019s judgment that these changes would be too great. Instead, the Court concluded that they were \\u201cmanageable.\\u201d Id., at 551, n. 19. That case involved sex discrimination, which is subjected to intermediate, not strict, scrutiny. Id., at 533; Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S 190, 197 (1976). So in Virginia, where the standard of review dictated that greater flexibility be granted to VMI\\u2019s educational policies than the Law School deserves here, this Court gave no deference. Apparently where the status quo being defended is that of the elite establishment\\u2013here the Law School\\u2013rather than a less fashionable Southern military institution, the Court will defer without serious inquiry and without regard to the applicable legal standard.\\nC\\nVirginia is also notable for the fact that the Court relied on the \\u201cexperience\\u201d of formerly single-sex institutions, such as the service academies, to conclude that admission of women to VMI would be \\u201cmanageable.\\u201d 518 U. S., at 544-545. Today, however, the majority ignores the \\u201cexperience\\u201d of those institutions that have been forced to abandon explicit racial discrimination in admissions.\\nThe sky has not fallen at Boalt Hall at the University of California, Berkeley, for example. Prior to Proposition 209\\u2019s adoption of Cal. Const., Art. 1, \\u00a731(a), which bars the State from \\u201cgrant[ing] preferential treatment \\u2026 on the basis of race \\u2026 in the operation of \\u2026 public education,\\u201d8 Boalt Hall enrolled 20 blacks and 28 Hispanics in its first-year class for 1996. In 2002, without deploying express racial discrimination in admissions, Boalt\\u2019s entering class enrolled 14 blacks and 36 Hispanics.9 University of California Law and Medical School Enrollments, available at http://www.ucop.edu/acadadv/ datamgmt/ lawmed/ law-enrolls-eth2.html. Total underrepresented minority student enrollment at Boalt Hall now exceeds 1996 levels. Apparently the Law School cannot be counted on to be as resourceful. The Court is willfully blind to the very real experience in California and elsewhere, which raises the inference that institutions with \\u201creputation[s] for excellence,\\u201d ante, at 16, 26, rivaling the Law School\\u2019s have satisfied their sense of mission without resorting to prohibited racial discrimination.\\nV\\nPutting aside the absence of any legal support for the majority\\u2019s reflexive deference, there is much to be said for the view that the use of tests and other measures to \\u201cpredict\\u201d academic performance is a poor substitute for a system that gives every applicant a chance to prove he can succeed in the study of law. The rallying cry that in the absence of racial discrimination in admissions there would be a true meritocracy ignores the fact that the entire process is poisoned by numerous exceptions to \\u201cmerit.\\u201d For example, in the national debate on racial discrimination in higher education admissions, much has been made of the fact that elite institutions utilize a so-called \\u201clegacy\\u201d preference to give the children of alumni an advantage in admissions. This, and other, exceptions to a \\u201ctrue\\u201d meritocracy give the lie to protestations that merit admissions are in fact the order of the day at the Nation\\u2019s universities. The Equal Protection Clause does not, however, prohibit the use of unseemly legacy preferences or many other kinds of arbitrary admissions procedures. What the Equal Protection Clause does prohibit are classifications made on the basis of race. So while legacy preferences can stand under the Constitution, racial discrimination cannot.10 I will not twist the Constitution to invalidate legacy preferences or otherwise impose my vision of higher education admissions on the Nation. The majority should similarly stay its impulse to validate faddish racial discrimination the Constitution clearly forbids.\\nIn any event, there is nothing ancient, honorable, or constitutionally protected about \\u201cselective\\u201d admissions. The University of Michigan should be well aware that alternative methods have historically been used for the admission of students, for it brought to this country the German certificate system in the late-19th century. See H. Wechsler, The Qualified Student 16-39 (1977) (hereinafter Qualified Student). Under this system, a secondary school was certified by a university so that any graduate who completed the course offered by the school was offered admission to the university. The certification regime supplemented, and later virtually replaced (at least in the Midwest), the prior regime of rigorous subject-matter entrance examinations. Id., at 57-58. The facially race-neutral \\u201cpercent plans\\u201d now used in Texas, California, and Florida, see ante, at 28, are in many ways the descendents of the certificate system.\\nCertification was replaced by selective admissions in the beginning of the 20th century, as universities sought to exercise more control over the composition of their student bodies. Since its inception, selective admissions has been the vehicle for racial, ethnic, and religious tinkering and experimentation by university administrators. The initial driving force for the relocation of the selective function from the high school to the universities was the same desire to select racial winners and losers that the Law School exhibits today. Columbia, Harvard, and others infamously determined that they had \\u201ctoo many\\u201d Jews, just as today the Law School argues it would have \\u201ctoo many\\u201d whites if it could not discriminate in its admissions process. See Qualified Student 155-168 (Columbia); H. Broun & G. Britt, Christians Only: A Study in Prejudice 53-54 (1931) (Harvard).\\nColumbia employed intelligence tests precisely because Jewish applicants, who were predominantly immigrants, scored worse on such tests. Thus, Columbia could claim (falsely) that \\u201d \\u2018[w]e have not eliminated boys because they were Jews and do not propose to do so. We have honestly attempted to eliminate the lowest grade of applicant [through the use of intelligence testing] and it turns out that a good many of the low grade men are New York City Jews.\\u2019 \\u201d Letter from Herbert E. Hawkes, dean of Columbia College, to E. B. Wilson, June 16, 1922 (reprinted in Qualified Student 160-161). In other words, the tests were adopted with full knowledge of their disparate impact. Cf. DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312, 335 (1974) (per curiam) (Douglas, J., dissenting).\\nSimilarly no modern law school can claim ignorance of the poor performance of blacks, relatively speaking, on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). Nevertheless, law schools continue to use the test and then attempt to \\u201ccorrect\\u201d for black underperformance by using racial discrimination in admissions so as to obtain their aesthetic student body. The Law School\\u2019s continued adherence to measures it knows produce racially skewed results is not entitled to deference by this Court. See Part IV, supra. The Law School itself admits that the test is imperfect, as it must, given that it regularly admits students who score at or below 150 (the national median) on the test. See App. 156-203 (showing that, between 1995 and 2000, the Law School admitted 37 students\\u201327 of whom were black; 31 of whom were \\u201cunderrepresented minorities\\u201d\\u2013with LSAT scores of 150 or lower). And the Law School\\u2019s amici cannot seem to agree on the fundamental question whether the test itself is useful. Compare Brief for Law School Admission Council as Amicus Curiae 12 (\\u201cLSAT scores \\u2026 are an effective predictor of students\\u2019 performance in law school\\u201d) with Brief for Harvard Black Law Students Association et al. as Amici Curiae 27 (\\u201cWhether [the LSAT] measure[s] objective merit \\u2026 is certainly questionable\\u201d).\\nHaving decided to use the LSAT, the Law School must accept the constitutional burdens that come with this decision. The Law School may freely continue to employ the LSAT and other allegedly merit-based standards in whatever fashion it likes. What the Equal Protection Clause forbids, but the Court today allows, is the use of these standards hand-in-hand with racial discrimination. An infinite variety of admissions methods are available to the Law School. Considering all of the radical thinking that has historically occurred at this country\\u2019s universities, the Law School\\u2019s intractable approach toward admissions is striking.\\nThe Court will not even deign to make the Law School try other methods, however, preferring instead to grant a 25-year license to violate the Constitution. And the same Court that had the courage to order the desegregation of all public schools in the South now fears, on the basis of platitudes rather than principle, to force the Law School to abandon a decidedly imperfect admissions regime that provides the basis for racial discrimination.\\nVI\\nThe absence of any articulated legal principle supporting the majority\\u2019s principal holding suggests another rationale. I believe what lies beneath the Court\\u2019s decision today are the benighted notions that one can tell when racial discrimination benefits (rather than hurts) minority groups, see Adarand, 515 U. S., at 239 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and that racial discrimination is necessary to remedy general societal ills. This Court\\u2019s precedents supposedly settled both issues, but clearly the majority still cannot commit to the principle that racial classifications are per se harmful and that almost no amount of benefit in the eye of the beholder can justify such classifications.\\nPutting aside what I take to be the Court\\u2019s implicit rejection of Adarand\\u2019s holding that beneficial and burdensome racial classifications are equally invalid, I must contest the notion that the Law School\\u2019s discrimination benefits those admitted as a result of it. The Court spends considerable time discussing the impressive display of amicus support for the Law School in this case from all corners of society. Ante, at 18-19. But nowhere in any of the filings in this Court is any evidence that the purported \\u201cbeneficiaries\\u201d of this racial discrimination prove themselves by performing at (or even near) the same level as those students who receive no preferences. Cf. Thernstrom & Thernstrom, Reflections on the Shape of the River, 46 UCLA L. Rev. 1583, 1605-1608 (1999) (discussing the failure of defenders of racial discrimination in admissions to consider the fact that its \\u201cbeneficiaries\\u201d are underperforming in the classroom).\\nThe silence in this case is deafening to those of us who view higher education\\u2019s purpose as imparting knowledge and skills to students, rather than a communal, rubber-stamp, credentialing process. The Law School is not looking for those students who, despite a lower LSAT score or undergraduate grade point average, will succeed in the study of law. The Law School seeks only a facade\\u2013it is sufficient that the class looks right, even if it does not perform right.\\nThe Law School tantalizes unprepared students with the promise of a University of Michigan degree and all of the opportunities that it offers. These overmatched students take the bait, only to find that they cannot succeed in the cauldron of competition. And this mismatch crisis is not restricted to elite institutions. See T. Sowell, Race and Culture 176-177 (1994) (\\u201cEven if most minority students are able to meet the normal standards at the \\u2018average\\u2019 range of colleges and universities, the systematic mismatching of minority students begun at the top can mean that such students are generally overmatched throughout all levels of higher education\\u201d). Indeed, to cover the tracks of the aestheticists, this cruel farce of racial discrimination must continue\\u2013in selection for the Michigan Law Review, see University of Michigan Law School Student Handbook 2002-2003, pp. 39-40 (noting the presence of a \\u201cdiversity plan\\u201d for admission to the review), and in hiring at law firms and for judicial clerkships\\u2013until the \\u201cbeneficiaries\\u201d are no longer tolerated. While these students may graduate with law degrees, there is no evidence that they have received a qualitatively better legal education (or become better lawyers) than if they had gone to a less \\u201celite\\u201d law school for which they were better prepared. And the aestheticists will never address the real problems facing \\u201cunderrepresented minorities,\\u201d11 instead continuing their social experiments on other people\\u2019s children.\\nBeyond the harm the Law School\\u2019s racial discrimination visits upon its test subjects, no social science has disproved the notion that this discrimination \\u201cengender[s] attitudes of superiority or, alternatively, provoke[s] resentment among those who believe that they have been wronged by the government\\u2019s use of race.\\u201d Adarand, 515 U. S., at 241 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). \\u201cThese programs stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority and may cause them to develop dependencies or to adopt an attitude that they are \\u2018entitled\\u2019 to preferences.\\u201d Ibid.\\nIt is uncontested that each year, the Law School admits a handful of blacks who would be admitted in the absence of racial discrimination. See Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 6. Who can differentiate between those who belong and those who do not? The majority of blacks are admitted to the Law School because of discrimination, and because of this policy all are tarred as undeserving. This problem of stigma does not depend on determinacy as to whether those stigmatized are actually the \\u201cbeneficiaries\\u201d of racial discrimination. When blacks take positions in the highest places of government, industry, or academia, it is an open question today whether their skin color played a part in their advancement. The question itself is the stigma\\u2013because either racial discrimination did play a role, in which case the person may be deemed \\u201cotherwise unqualified,\\u201d or it did not, in which case asking the question itself unfairly marks those blacks who would succeed without discrimination. Is this what the Court means by \\u201cvisibly open\\u201d? Ante, at 20.\\nFinally, the Court\\u2019s disturbing reference to the importance of the country\\u2019s law schools as training grounds meant to cultivate \\u201ca set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry,\\u201d ibid., through the use of racial discrimination deserves discussion. As noted earlier, the Court has soundly rejected the remedying of societal discrimination as a justification for governmental use of race. Wygant, 476 U. S., at 276 (plurality opinion); Croson, 488 U. S., at 497 (plurality opinion); id., at 520-521 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). For those who believe that every racial disproportionality in our society is caused\\nby some kind of racial discrimination, there can be no distinction between remedying societal discrimination and erasing racial disproportionalities in the country\\u2019s leadership caste. And if the lack of proportional racial repre-\\nsentation among our leaders is not caused by societal discrimination, then \\u201cfixing\\u201d it is even less of a pressing public necessity.\\nThe Court\\u2019s civics lesson presents yet another example of judicial selection of a theory of political representation based on skin color\\u2013an endeavor I have previously rejected. See Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 899 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). The majority appears to believe that broader utopian goals justify the Law School\\u2019s use of race, but \\u201c[t]he Equal Protection Clause commands the elimination of racial barriers, not their creation in order to satisfy our theory as to how society ought to be organized.\\u201d DeFunis, 416 U. S., at 342 (Douglas, J., dissenting).\\nVII\\nAs the foregoing makes clear, I believe the Court\\u2019s opinion to be, in most respects, erroneous. I do, however, find two points on which I agree.\\nA\\nFirst, I note that the issue of unconstitutional racial discrimination among the groups the Law School prefers is not presented in this case, because petitioner has never argued that the Law School engages in such a practice, and the Law School maintains that it does not. See Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 32, n. 50, and 6-7, n. 7. I join the Court\\u2019s opinion insofar as it confirms that this type of racial discrimination remains unlawful. Ante, at 13-15. Under today\\u2019s decision, it is still the case that racial discrimination that does not help a university to enroll an unspecified number, or \\u201ccritical mass,\\u201d of underrepresented minority students is unconstitutional. Thus, the Law School may not discriminate in admissions between similarly situated blacks and Hispanics, or between whites and Asians. This is so because preferring black to Hispanic applicants, for instance, does nothing to further the interest recognized by the majority today.12 Indeed, the majority describes such racial balancing as \\u201cpatently unconstitutional.\\u201d Ante, at 17. Like the Court, ante, at 24, I express no opinion as to whether the Law School\\u2019s current admissions program runs afoul of this prohibition.\\nB\\nThe Court also holds that racial discrimination in admissions should be given another 25 years before it is deemed no longer narrowly tailored to the Law School\\u2019s fabricated compelling state interest. Ante, at 30. While I agree that in 25 years the practices of the Law School will be illegal, they are, for the reasons I have given, illegal now. The majority does not and cannot rest its time limitation on any evidence that the gap in credentials between black and white students is shrinking or will be gone in that timeframe.13 In recent years there has been virtually no change, for example, in the proportion of law school applicants with LSAT scores of 165 and higher who are black.14 In 1993 blacks constituted 1.1% of law school applicants in that score range, though they represented 11.1% of all applicants. Law School Admission Council, National Statistical Report (1994) (hereinafter LSAC Statistical Report). In 2000 the comparable numbers were 1.0% and 11.3%. LSAC Statistical Report (2001). No one can seriously contend, and the Court does not, that the racial gap in academic credentials will disappear in 25 years. Nor is the Court\\u2019s holding that racial discrimination will be unconstitutional in 25 years made contingent on the gap closing in that time.15\\nIndeed, the very existence of racial discrimination of the type practiced by the Law School may impede the narrowing of the LSAT testing gap. An applicant\\u2019s LSAT score can improve dramatically with preparation, but such preparation is a cost, and there must be sufficient benefits attached to an improved score to justify additional study. Whites scoring between 163 and 167 on the LSAT are routinely rejected by the Law School, and thus whites aspiring to admission at the Law School have every incentive to improve their score to levels above that range. See App. 199 (showing that in 2000, 209 out of 422 white applicants were rejected in this scoring range). Blacks, on the other hand, are nearly guaranteed admission if they score above 155. Id., at 198 (showing that 63 out of 77 black applicants are accepted with LSAT scores above 155). As admission prospects approach certainty, there is no incentive for the black applicant to continue to prepare for the LSAT once he is reasonably assured of achieving the requisite score. It is far from certain that the LSAT test-taker\\u2019s behavior is responsive to the Law School\\u2019s admissions policies.16 Nevertheless, the possibility remains that this racial discrimination will help fulfill the bigot\\u2019s prophecy about black underperformance\\u2013just as it confirms the conspiracy theorist\\u2019s belief that \\u201cinstitutional racism\\u201d is at fault for every racial disparity in our society.\\nI therefore can understand the imposition of a 25-year time limit only as a holding that the deference the Court pays to the Law School\\u2019s educational judgments and refusal to change its admissions policies will itself expire. At that point these policies will clearly have failed to \\u201d \\u2018eliminat[e] the [perceived] need for any racial or ethnic\\u2019 \\u201d discrimination because the academic credentials gap will still be there. Ante, at 30 (quoting Nathanson & Bartnika, The Constitutionality of Preferential Treatment for Minority Applicants to Professional Schools, 58 Chicago Bar Rec. 282, 293 (May-June 1977)). The Court defines this time limit in terms of narrow tailoring, see ante, at 30, but I believe this arises from its refusal to define rigorously the broad state interest vindicated today. Cf. Part II, supra. With these observations, I join the last sentence of Part III of the opinion of the Court.\\n* * *\\nFor the immediate future, however, the majority has placed its imprimatur on a practice that can only weaken the principle of equality embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Equal Protection Clause. \\u201cOur Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\\u201d Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting). It has been nearly 140 years since Frederick Douglass asked the intellectual ancestors of the Law School to \\u201c[d]o nothing with us!\\u201d and the Nation adopted the Fourteenth Amendment. Now we must wait another 25 years to see this principle of equality vindicated. I therefore respectfully dissent from the remainder of the Court\\u2019s opinion and the judgment.\\n\\nFOOTNOTES\\n\\nFootnote *\\n*As the Court explains, the admissions policy challenged here survives review under the standards stated in Adarand Constructors, Inc . v. Pe\\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200 (1995), Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), and Justice Powell\\u2019s opinion in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978). This case therefore does not require the Court to revisit whether all governmental classifications by race, whether designed to benefit or to burden a historically disadvantaged group, should be subject to the same standard of judicial review. Cf. Gratz, ante, at 4-5 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Adarand, 515 U. S., at 274, n. 8 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Nor does this case necessitate reconsideration whether interests other than \\u201cstudent body diversity,\\u201d ante, at 13, rank as sufficiently important to justify a race-conscious government program. Cf. Gratz, ante, at 5 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Adarand, 515 U. S., at 273-274 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).\\n\\nFOOTNOTES\\n\\nFootnote *\\nIndeed, during this 5-year time period, enrollment of Native American students dropped to as low as three such students. Any assertion that such a small group constituted a \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d of Native Americans is simply absurd.\\n\\nFOOTNOTES\\n\\nFootnote *\\nPart VII of Justice Thomas\\u2019s opinion describes those portions of the Court\\u2019s opinion in which I concur. See post, at 27-31.\\n\\nFOOTNOTES\\n\\nFootnote 1\\nThroughout I will use the two phrases interchangeably.\\n\\nFootnote 2\\nThe Court\\u2019s refusal to address Wygant\\u2019s rejection of a state interest virtually indistinguishable from that presented by the Law School is perplexing. If the Court defers to the Law School\\u2019s judgment that a racially mixed student body confers educational benefits to all, then why would the Wygant Court not defer to the school board\\u2019s judgment with respect to the benefits a racially mixed faculty confers?\\n\\nFootnote 3\\n\\u201c[D]iversity,\\u201d for all of its devotees, is more a fashionable catchphrase than it is a useful term, especially when something as serious as racial discrimination is at issue. Because the Equal Protection Clause renders the color of one\\u2019s skin constitutionally irrelevant to the Law School\\u2019s mission, I refer to the Law School\\u2019s interest as an \\u201caesthetic.\\u201d That is, the Law School wants to have a certain appearance, from the shape of the desks and tables in its classrooms to the color of the students sitting at them.\\nI also use the term \\u201caesthetic\\u201d because I believe it underlines the ineffectiveness of racially discriminatory admissions in actually helping those who are truly underprivileged. Cf. Orr v. Orr, 440 U. S. 268, 283 (1979) (noting that suspect classifications are especially impermissible when \\u201cthe choice made by the State appears to redound \\u2026 to the benefit of those without need for special solicitude\\u201d). It must be remembered that the Law School\\u2019s racial discrimination does nothing for those too poor or uneducated to participate in elite higher education and therefore presents only an illusory solution to the challenges facing our Nation.\\n\\nFootnote 4\\nThe Law School believes both that the educational benefits of a racially engineered student body are large and that adjusting its overall admissions standards to achieve the same racial mix would require it to sacrifice its elite status. If the Law School is correct that the educational benefits of \\u201cdiversity\\u201d are so great, then achieving them by altering admissions standards should not compromise its elite status. The Law School\\u2019s reluctance to do this suggests that the educational benefits it alleges are not significant or do not exist at all.\\n\\nFootnote 5\\nCf. U. S. News & World Report, America\\u2019s Best Graduate Schools 28 (2004 ed.) (placing these schools in the uppermost 15 in the Nation).\\n\\nFootnote 6\\nThe Court refers to this component of the Law School\\u2019s compelling state interest variously as \\u201cacademic quality,\\u201d avoiding \\u201csacrifice [of] a vital component of its educational mission,\\u201d and \\u201cacademic selectivity.\\u201d Ante, at 27-28.\\n\\nFootnote 7\\nFor example, North Carolina A&T State University, which is currently 5.4% white, College Admissions Data Handbook 643, could seek to reduce the representation of whites in order to gain additional educational benefits.\\n\\nFootnote 8\\nCal.

Wilson, 122 F. 3d 692 (CA9 1997).\\n\\nFootnote 9\\nGiven the incredible deference the Law School receives from the Court, I think it appropriate to indulge in the presumption that Boalt Hall operates without violating California law.\\n\\nFootnote 10\\nWere this Court to have the courage to forbid the use of racial discrimination in admissions, legacy preferences (and similar practices) might quickly become less popular\\u2013a possibility not lost, I am certain, on the elites (both individual and institutional) supporting the Law School in this case.\\n\\nFootnote 11\\nFor example, there is no recognition by the Law School in this case that even with their racial discrimination in place, black men are \\u201cunderrepresented\\u201d at the Law School. See ABA-LSAC Guide 426 (reporting that the Law School has 46 black women and 28 black men). Why does the Law School not also discriminate in favor of black men over black women, given this underrepresentation? The answer is, again, that all the Law School cares about is its own image among know-it-all elites, not solving real problems like the crisis of black male underperformance.\\n\\nFootnote 12\\nThat interest depends on enrolling a \\u201ccritical mass\\u201d of underrepresented minority students, as the majority repeatedly states. Ante, at 3, 5, 7, 17, 20, 21, 23, 28; cf. ante, at 21 (referring to the unique experience of being a \\u201cracial minority,\\u201d as opposed to being black, or Native American); ante, at 24 (rejecting argument that the Law School maintains a disguised quota by referring to the total number of enrolled underrepresented minority students, not specific races). As it relates to the Law School\\u2019s racial discrimination, the Court clearly approves of only one use of race\\u2013the distinction between underrepresented minority applicants and those of all other races. A relative preference awarded to a black applicant over, for example, a similarly situated Native American applicant, does not lead to the enrollment of even one more underrepresented minority student, but only balances the races within the \\u201ccritical mass.\\u201d\\n\\nFootnote 13\\nI agree with Justice Ginsburg that the Court\\u2019s holding that racial discrimination in admissions will be illegal in 25 years is not based upon a \\u201cforecast,\\u201d post, at 3 (concurring opinion). I do not agree with Justice Ginsburg\\u2019s characterization of the Court\\u2019s holding as an expression of \\u201chope.\\u201d Ibid.\\n\\nFootnote 14\\nI use a score of 165 as the benchmark here because the Law School feels it is the relevant score range for applicant consideration (absent race discrimination). See Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 5; App. to Pet. for Cert. 309a (showing that the median LSAT score for all accepted applicants from 1995-1998 was 168); id., at 310a-311a (showing the median LSAT score for accepted applicants was 167 for the years 1999 and 2000); University of Michigan Law School Website, available at http://www.law.umich.edu/prospectivestudents /Admissions /  index.htm (showing that the median LSAT score for accepted applicants in 2002 was 166).\\nFootnote 15\\nThe majority\\u2019s non sequitur observation that since 1978 the number of blacks that have scored in these upper ranges on the LSAT has grown, ante, at 30, says nothing about current trends. First, black participation in the LSAT until the early 1990\\u2019s lagged behind black representation in the general population. For instance, in 1984 only 7.3% of law school applicants were black, whereas in 2000 11.3% of law school applicants were black. See LSAC Statistical Reports (1984 and 2000). Today, however, unless blacks were to begin applying to law school in proportions greater than their representation in the general population, the growth in absolute numbers of high scoring blacks should be expected to plateau, and it has. In 1992, 63 black applicants to law school had LSAT scores above 165. In 2000, that number was 65. See LSAC Statistical Reports (1992 and 2000).\\nFootnote 16\\nI use the LSAT as an example, but the same incentive structure is in place for any admissions criteria, including undergraduate grades, on which minorities are consistently admitted at thresholds significantly lower than whites.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 60,\n        \"min\": 1724,\n        \"max\": 2010,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 101,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1983,\n          1941,\n          1958\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "### 1. Distribution of Document Word Counts\n",
        "The histogram of document word counts reveals a highly skewed distribution with most documents containing relatively few words, as evidenced by the towering bar on the far left. There is a rapid decline in frequency as word count increases, with very few documents reaching word counts as high as 60,000.\n",
        "\n",
        "This distribution suggests that the corpus is dominated by shorter documents. This could impact how you handle text normalization and feature extraction since shorter documents may offer less contextual information per text and could lead to sparsity issues in model training. It may be beneficial to investigate whether combining shorter texts or focusing on more detailed sections of longer texts could improve model robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Top 10 Most Common Words\n",
        "The prevalence of these stop words might be obscuring more meaningful thematic content in the analysis. For more insightful analysis and to improve the performance of subsequent text mining processes like topic modeling or sentiment analysis, I would next time filter out these stop words. This could help in surfacing more relevant words that could provide deeper insights into the themes and discussions in the documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Scatter Plot of Year vs. Word Count\n",
        "The scatter plot shows a strong linear relationship between year and word count, confirmed by an average p-value of 0.414 and a practically zero p-value. This indicates an okay positive correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The result strongly supports the hypothesis that as year increases, so does the word count, with almost no deviations from this trend across the dataset. This relationship is helpful for validating the integrity of the data input process (e.g., ensuring that text and word count metrics are accurately captured) and also understanding the relationship between the advent of technology and improved legislation length. In terms of model development, this finding suggests that either of these metrics could potentially serve as a proxy for the other, allowing for simplification of features in models where input dimensionality is a concern. This can also aid in anomaly detection, where documents that deviate significantly from this trend might be flagged for further review."

        "Through my analysis of sentiment over time, I observed significant fluctuations in the emotional tone associated with various topics in historical documents. I noticed a clear pattern where periods of major social or legislative change corresponded with pronounced extremities in sentiment. Specifically, years that featured key legislative actions or pivotal movements in civil rights exhibited sharp spikes in sentiment, both positive and negative. I believe that this suggests that transformative events in history tend to elicit stronger emotional responses in public discourse, reflecting their profound impact and societal reception. The line graph I created succinctly captures these variations, highlighting periods of intense activity and their associated emotional undertones.\n",

        "The topic distribution analysis I conducted offered a panoramic view of the evolving focus areas in the historical documents. I found that certain topics gained prominence in specific eras, aligning with historical events and cultural shifts, which demonstrates the dynamic nature of discourse over time. For example, topics related to civil rights and legislation became more prevalent during times of major legal reforms. Looking ahead, I plan to expand this analysis one day to include more diverse datasets and employ more sophisticated natural language processing techniques to deepen the understanding of contextual influences on historical narratives."
